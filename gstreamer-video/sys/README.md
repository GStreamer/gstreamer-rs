[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) (Video library) FFI bindings for Rust.

These bindings are providing unsafe FFI API that can be used to interface with
GStreamer. Generally they are meant to be used as the building block for
higher-level abstractions like:

  * Bindings for GStreamer applications and plugins: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs
  * Various GStreamer plugins written in Rust: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs

The bindings are autogenerated with [gir](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/)
based on the [GObject-Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection/)
API metadata provided by the GStreamer project.
