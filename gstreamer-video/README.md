# gstreamer-rs [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gstreamer-video.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gstreamer-video) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sdroege/gstreamer-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sdroege/gstreamer-rs)

[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) (Video library) bindings for Rust.
Documentation can be found [here](https://sdroege.github.io/rustdoc/gstreamer/gstreamer/).

These bindings are providing a safe API that can be used to interface with
GStreamer, e.g. for writing GStreamer-based applications.

For background and motivation, see the [announcement blogpost](https://coaxion.net/blog/2017/07/writing-gstreamer-applications-in-rust/).

The bindings (since 0.8.0) are autogenerated with [gir](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/)
based on the [GObject-Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection/)
API metadata provided by the GStreamer project. Older versions before 0.8.0 were manually
written and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/arturoc/gstreamer1.0-rs).
The API of the two is incompatible.

A crate for writing GStreamer plugins in Rust can be found here: https://github.com/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs
