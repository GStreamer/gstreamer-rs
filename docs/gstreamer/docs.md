<!-- struct Bin -->
`Bin` is an element that can contain other `Element`, allowing them to be
managed as a group.
Pads from the child elements can be ghosted to the bin, see `GhostPad`.
This makes the bin look like any other elements and enables creation of
higher-level abstraction elements.

A new `Bin` is created with `Bin::new`. Use a `Pipeline` instead if you
want to create a toplevel bin because a normal bin doesn't have a bus or
handle clock distribution of its own.

After the bin has been created you will typically add elements to it with
`BinExt::add`. You can remove elements with `BinExt::remove`.

An element can be retrieved from a bin with `BinExt::get_by_name`, using the
elements name. `BinExt::get_by_name_recurse_up` is mainly used for internal
purposes and will query the parent bins when the element is not found in the
current bin.

An iterator of elements in a bin can be retrieved with
`BinExt::iterate_elements`. Various other iterators exist to retrieve the
elements in a bin.

`GstObjectExt::unref` is used to drop your reference to the bin.

The `Bin::element-added` signal is fired whenever a new element is added to
the bin. Likewise the `Bin::element-removed` signal is fired whenever an
element is removed from the bin.

## Notes

A `Bin` internally intercepts every `Message` posted by its children and
implements the following default behaviour for each of them:

* GST_MESSAGE_EOS: This message is only posted by sinks in the PLAYING
state. If all sinks posted the EOS message, this bin will post and EOS
message upwards.

* GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_START: Just collected and never forwarded upwards.
The messages are used to decide when all elements have completed playback
of their segment.

* GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE: Is posted by `Bin` when all elements that posted
a SEGMENT_START have posted a SEGMENT_DONE.

* GST_MESSAGE_DURATION_CHANGED: Is posted by an element that detected a change
in the stream duration. The default bin behaviour is to clear any
cached duration values so that the next duration query will perform
a full duration recalculation. The duration change is posted to the
application so that it can refetch the new duration with a duration
query. Note that these messages can be posted before the bin is
prerolled, in which case the duration query might fail.

* GST_MESSAGE_CLOCK_LOST: This message is posted by an element when it
can no longer provide a clock. The default bin behaviour is to
check if the lost clock was the one provided by the bin. If so and
the bin is currently in the PLAYING state, the message is forwarded to
the bin parent.
This message is also generated when a clock provider is removed from
the bin. If this message is received by the application, it should
PAUSE the pipeline and set it back to PLAYING to force a new clock
distribution.

* GST_MESSAGE_CLOCK_PROVIDE: This message is generated when an element
can provide a clock. This mostly happens when a new clock
provider is added to the bin. The default behaviour of the bin is to
mark the currently selected clock as dirty, which will perform a clock
recalculation the next time the bin is asked to provide a clock.
This message is never sent tot the application but is forwarded to
the parent of the bin.

* OTHERS: posted upwards.

A `Bin` implements the following default behaviour for answering to a
`Query`:

* GST_QUERY_DURATION:If the query has been asked before with the same format
and the bin is a toplevel bin (ie. has no parent),
use the cached previous value. If no previous value was cached, the
query is sent to all sink elements in the bin and the MAXIMUM of all
values is returned. If the bin is a toplevel bin the value is cached.
If no sinks are available in the bin, the query fails.

* GST_QUERY_POSITION:The query is sent to all sink elements in the bin and the
MAXIMUM of all values is returned. If no sinks are available in the bin,
the query fails.

* OTHERS:the query is forwarded to all sink elements, the result
of the first sink that answers the query successfully is returned. If no
sink is in the bin, the query fails.

A `Bin` will by default forward any event sent to it to all sink
(`EventTypeFlags::Downstream`) or source (`EventTypeFlags::Upstream`) elements
depending on the event type.
If all the elements return `true`, the bin will also return `true`, else `false`
is returned. If no elements of the required type are in the bin, the event
handler will return `true`.

# Returns

unlinked pad of the given
direction, `None`.
<!-- trait BinExt::fn get_by_interface -->
Looks for an element inside the bin that implements the given
interface. If such an element is found, it returns the element.

all elements that implement the interface, use
`BinExt::iterate_all_by_interface`. This function recurses into child bins.

MT safe. Caller owns returned reference.
## `iface`

Gets an iterator for the elements in this bin in topologically
sorted order. This means that the elements are returned from
the most downstream elements (sinks) to the sources.

This function is used internally to perform the state changes
of the bin elements and for clock selection.

MT safe. Caller owns returned value.

# Returns

a `Iterator` of `Element`,

<!-- trait BinExt::fn iterate_sources -->
Gets an iterator for all elements in the bin that have the
`ElementFlags::Source` flag set.

<!-- trait BinExt::fn recalculate_latency -->
Query `self` for the current latency using and reconfigures this latency to all the
elements with a LATENCY event.

This method is typically called on the pipeline when a `MessageType::Latency`
is posted on the bus.

This function simply emits the 'do-latency' signal so any custom latency
calculations will be performed.

# Returns

`true` if the latency could be queried and reconfigured.
<!-- trait BinExt::fn remove -->
Removes the element from the bin, unparenting it as well.
Unparenting the element means that the element will be dereferenced,
so if the bin holds the only reference to the element, the element
will be freed in the process of removing it from the bin. If you
want the element to still exist after removing, you need to call
`GstObjectExt::ref` before removing it from the bin.

If the element's pads are linked to other pads, the pads will be unlinked
before the element is removed from the bin.

MT safe.
## `element`

<!-- trait BinExt::fn connect_do_latency -->
Will be emitted when the bin needs to perform latency calculations. This
signal is only emitted for toplevel bins or when async-handling is
enabled.

Only one signal handler is invoked. If no signals are connected, the
default handler is invoked, which will query and distribute the lowest
possible latency to all sinks.

Connect to this signal if the default latency calculations are not
sufficient, like when you need different latencies for different sinks in
the same pipeline.

of its children on its own.
<!-- trait BinExt::fn set_property_async-handling -->
If set to `true`, the bin will handle asynchronous state changes.
This should be used only if the bin subclass is modifying the state
of its children on its own.
<!-- trait BinExt::fn get_property_message-forward -->
Forward all children messages, even those that would normally be filtered by
the bin. This can be interesting when one wants to be notified of the EOS
state of individual elements, for example.

The messages are converted to an ELEMENT message with the bin as the
source. The structure of the message is named 'GstBinForwarded' and contains
a field named 'message' of type GST_TYPE_MESSAGE that contains the original
forwarded message.
<!-- trait BinExt::fn set_property_message-forward -->
Forward all children messages, even those that would normally be filtered by
the bin. This can be interesting when one wants to be notified of the EOS
state of individual elements, for example.

The messages are converted to an ELEMENT message with the bin as the
source. The structure of the message is named 'GstBinForwarded' and contains
a field named 'message' of type GST_TYPE_MESSAGE that contains the original
forwarded message.
<!-- struct Buffer -->
Buffers are the basic unit of data transfer in GStreamer. They contain the
timing and offset along with other arbitrary metadata that is associated
with the `Memory` blocks that the buffer contains.

Buffers are usually created with `Buffer::new`. After a buffer has been
created one will typically allocate memory for it and add it to the buffer.
The following example creates a buffer that can hold a given video frame
with a given width, height and bits per plane.

```C
  GstBuffer *buffer;
  GstMemory *memory;
  gint size, width, height, bpp;
  ...
  size = width * height * bpp;
  buffer = gst_buffer_new ();
  memory = gst_allocator_alloc (NULL, size, NULL);
  gst_buffer_insert_memory (buffer, -1, memory);
  ...
```

Alternatively, use `Buffer::new_allocate` to create a buffer with
preallocated data of a given size.

Buffers can contain a list of `Memory` objects. You can retrieve how many
memory objects with `Buffer::n_memory` and you can get a pointer
to memory with `Buffer::peek_memory`

A buffer will usually have timestamps, and a duration, but neither of these
are guaranteed (they may be set to `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`). Whenever a
meaningful value can be given for these, they should be set. The timestamps
and duration are measured in nanoseconds (they are `ClockTime` values).

The buffer DTS refers to the timestamp when the buffer should be decoded and
is usually monotonically increasing. The buffer PTS refers to the timestamp when
the buffer content should be presented to the user and is not always
monotonically increasing.

A buffer can also have one or both of a start and an end offset. These are
media-type specific. For video buffers, the start offset will generally be
the frame number. For audio buffers, it will be the number of samples
produced so far. For compressed data, it could be the byte offset in a
source or destination file. Likewise, the end offset will be the offset of
the end of the buffer. These can only be meaningfully interpreted if you
know the media type of the buffer (the preceding CAPS event). Either or both
can be set to `GST_BUFFER_OFFSET_NONE`.

`gst_buffer_ref` is used to increase the refcount of a buffer. This must be
done when you want to keep a handle to the buffer after pushing it to the
next element. The buffer refcount determines the writability of the buffer, a
buffer is only writable when the refcount is exactly 1, i.e. when the caller
has the only reference to the buffer.

To efficiently create a smaller buffer out of an existing one, you can
use `Buffer::copy_region`. This method tries to share the memory objects
between the two buffers.

If a plug-in wants to modify the buffer data or metadata in-place, it should
first obtain a buffer that is safe to modify by using
`gst_buffer_make_writable`. This function is optimized so that a copy will
only be made when it is necessary.

Several flags of the buffer can be set and unset with the
GST_BUFFER_FLAG_SET() and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_UNSET() macros. Use
GST_BUFFER_FLAG_IS_SET() to test if a certain `BufferFlags` flag is set.

Buffers can be efficiently merged into a larger buffer with
`Buffer::append`. Copying of memory will only be done when absolutely
needed.

Arbitrary extra metadata can be set on a buffer with `Buffer::add_meta`.
Metadata can be retrieved with `Buffer::get_meta`. See also `Meta`

An element should either unref the buffer or push it out on a src pad
using `Pad::push` (see `Pad`).

Buffers are usually freed by unreffing them with `gst_buffer_unref`. When
the refcount drops to 0, any memory and metadata pointed to by the buffer is
unreffed as well. Buffers allocated from a `BufferPool` will be returned to
the pool when the refcount drops to 0.

The `ParentBufferMeta` is a meta which can be attached to a `Buffer`
to hold a reference to another buffer that is only released when the child
`Buffer` is released.

Typically, `ParentBufferMeta` is used when the child buffer is directly
using the `Memory` of the parent buffer, and wants to prevent the parent
buffer from being returned to a buffer pool until the `Memory` is available
for re-use. (Since 1.6)

`gst_buffer_is_writable` to check that if needed.
## `idx`
an index
## `length`
a length should not be 0

# Returns

`true` if the memory range is writable

## `idx`
an index

# Returns

the `Memory` at `idx`.
<!-- impl Buffer::fn prepend_memory -->
Prepend the memory block `mem` to `self`. This function takes

<!-- struct BufferList -->
Buffer lists are an object containing a list of buffers.

Buffer lists are created with `BufferList::new` and filled with data
using a `BufferList::insert`.

Buffer lists can be pushed on a srcpad with `Pad::push_list`. This is
interesting when multiple buffers need to be pushed in one go because it
can reduce the amount of overhead for pushing each buffer individually.
<!-- impl BufferList::fn new -->

the returned `BufferList`.

Free-function: gst_buffer_list_unref

# Returns

the new `BufferList`. `gst_buffer_list_unref`

the amount to remove
<!-- struct BufferPool -->
A `BufferPool` is an object that can be used to pre-allocate and recycle
buffers of the same size and with the same properties.

A `BufferPool` is created with `BufferPool::new`.

Once a pool is created, it needs to be configured. A call to
`BufferPool::get_config` returns the current configuration structure from
the pool. With `BufferPool::config_set_params` and
`BufferPool::config_set_allocator` the bufferpool parameters and
allocator can be configured. Other properties can be configured in the pool
depending on the pool implementation.

A bufferpool can have extra options that can be enabled with
`BufferPool::config_add_option`. The available options can be retrieved
with `BufferPoolExt::get_options`. Some options allow for additional
configuration properties to be set.

After the configuration structure has been configured,
`BufferPool::set_config` updates the configuration in the pool. This can
fail when the configuration structure is not accepted.

After the a pool has been configured, it can be activated with
`BufferPoolExt::set_active`. This will preallocate the configured resources
in the pool.

When the pool is active, `BufferPool::acquire_buffer` can be used to
retrieve a buffer from the pool.

Buffers allocated from a bufferpool will automatically be returned to the
pool with `BufferPool::release_buffer` when their refcount drops to 0.

The bufferpool can be deactivated again with `BufferPoolExt::set_active`.
All further `BufferPool::acquire_buffer` calls will return an error. When
all buffers are returned to the pool they will be freed.

Use `GstObjectExt::unref` to release the reference to a bufferpool. If the
refcount of the pool reaches 0, the pool will be freed.

# Implements

[`BufferPoolExt`](trait.BufferPoolExt.html), [`GstObjectExt`](trait.GstObjectExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt -->
Trait containing all `BufferPool` methods.

# Implementors

[`BufferPool`](struct.BufferPool.html)
<!-- impl BufferPool::fn new -->
Creates a new `BufferPool` instance.

# Returns

a new `BufferPool` instance
<!-- impl BufferPool::fn config_add_option -->

<!-- impl BufferPool::fn config_n_options -->
Retrieve the number of values currently stored in the options array of the
`config` structure.
## `config`
a `BufferPool` configuration

# Returns

the options array size as a `guint`.
<!-- impl BufferPool::fn config_set_allocator -->
Set the `allocator` and `params` on `config`.

One of `allocator` and `params` can be `None`, but not both. When `allocator`
is `None`, the default allocator of the pool will use the values in `param`
to perform its allocation. When `param` is `None`, the pool will use the
provided `allocator` with its default `AllocationParams`.

A call to `BufferPool::set_config` can update the allocator and params
with the values that it is able to do. Some pools are, for example, not able
to operate with different allocators or cannot allocate with the values
specified in `params`. Use `BufferPool::get_config` to get the currently
used values.
## `config`
a `BufferPool` configuration
## `allocator`
a `Allocator`
## `params`
`AllocationParams`
<!-- impl BufferPool::fn config_set_params -->
Configure `config` with the given parameters.
## `config`

## `max_buffers`
the maximum amount of buffers to allocate or 0 for unlimited.
<!-- impl BufferPool::fn config_validate_params -->
Validate that changes made to `config` are still valid in the context of the
expected parameters. This function is a helper that can be used to validate
changes made by a pool to a config when `BufferPool::set_config`
returns `false`. This expects that `caps` haven't changed and that
`min_buffers` aren't lower then what we initially expected.
This does not check if options or allocator parameters are still valid,
won't check if size have changed, since changing the size is valid to adapt
padding.
## `config`
a `BufferPool` configuration
## `caps`
the excepted caps of buffers
## `size`
the expected size of each buffer, not including prefix and padding
## `min_buffers`
the expected minimum amount of buffers to allocate.

the expect maximum amount of buffers to allocate or 0 for unlimited.

# Returns

`true`, if the parameters are valid in this context.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn acquire_buffer -->

## `params`
parameters.

# Returns

a `FlowReturn` such as `FlowReturn::Flushing` when the pool is
inactive.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn get_config -->
Get a copy of the current configuration of the pool. This configuration
can either be modified and used for the `BufferPool::set_config` call
or it must be freed after usage.

# Returns

a copy of the current configuration of `self`. use
`Structure::free` after usage or `BufferPool::set_config`.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn get_options -->
Get a `None` terminated array of string with supported bufferpool options for
`self`. An option would typically be enabled with
`BufferPool::config_add_option`.

# Returns

a `None` terminated array
 of strings.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn has_option -->
Check if the bufferpool supports `option`.
## `option`
an option

# Returns

`true` if the buffer pool contains `option`.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn is_active -->
Check if `self` is active. A pool can be activated with the
`BufferPoolExt::set_active` call.

# Returns

`true` when the pool is active.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn release_buffer -->
Release `buffer` to `self`. `buffer` should have previously been allocated from
`self` with `BufferPool::acquire_buffer`.

This function is usually called automatically when the last ref on `buffer`
disappears.
## `buffer`
a `Buffer`
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn set_active -->
Control the active state of `self`. When the pool is inactive, new calls to
`BufferPool::acquire_buffer` will return with `FlowReturn::Flushing`.

Activating the bufferpool will preallocate all resources in the pool based on
the configuration of the pool.

Deactivating will free the resources again when there are no outstanding
buffers. When there are outstanding buffers, they will be freed as soon as
they are all returned to the pool.
## `active`
the new active state

# Returns

`false` when the pool was not configured or when preallocation of the
buffers failed.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn set_config -->
Set the configuration of the pool. If the pool is already configured, and
the configuration haven't change, this function will return `true`. If the
pool is active, this method will return `false` and active configuration
will remain. Buffers allocated form this pool must be returned or else this
function will do nothing and return `false`.

`config` is a `Structure` that contains the configuration parameters for
the pool. A default and mandatory set of parameters can be configured with
`BufferPool::config_set_params`, `BufferPool::config_set_allocator`
and `BufferPool::config_add_option`.

If the parameters in `config` can not be set exactly, this function returns
`false` and will try to update as much state as possible. The new state can
then be retrieved and refined with `BufferPool::get_config`.

This function takes ownership of `config`.
## `config`
a `Structure`

# Returns

`true` when the configuration could be set.
<!-- trait BufferPoolExt::fn set_flushing -->
Enable or disable the flushing state of a `self` without freeing or
allocating buffers.
## `flushing`
whether to start or stop flushing
<!-- enum BufferingMode -->
The different types of buffering methods.
<!-- enum BufferingMode::variant Stream -->
a small amount of data is buffered
<!-- enum BufferingMode::variant Download -->
the stream is being downloaded
<!-- enum BufferingMode::variant Timeshift -->
the stream is being downloaded in a ringbuffer
<!-- enum BufferingMode::variant Live -->
the stream is a live stream
<!-- struct Bus -->
The `Bus` is an object responsible for delivering `Message` packets in
a first-in first-out way from the streaming threads (see `Task`) to the
application.

Since the application typically only wants to deal with delivery of these
messages from one thread, the GstBus will marshall the messages between
different threads. This is important since the actual streaming of media
is done in another thread than the application.

The GstBus provides support for `glib::Source` based notifications. This makes it
possible to handle the delivery in the glib mainloop.

The `glib::Source` callback function `Bus::async_signal_func` can be used to
convert all bus messages into signal emissions.

A message is posted on the bus with the `Bus::post` method. With the
`Bus::peek` and `Bus::pop` methods one can look at or retrieve a
previously posted message.

The bus can be polled with the `Bus::poll` method. This methods blocks
up to the specified timeout value until one of the specified messages types
is posted on the bus. The application can then `Bus::pop` the messages
from the bus to handle them.
Alternatively the application can register an asynchronous bus function
using `Bus::add_watch_full` or `Bus::add_watch`. This function will
install a `glib::Source` in the default glib main loop and will deliver messages
a short while after they have been posted. Note that the main loop should
be running for the asynchronous callbacks.

It is also possible to get messages from the bus without any thread
marshalling with the `Bus::set_sync_handler` method. This makes it
possible to react to a message in the same thread that posted the
message on the bus. This should only be used if the application is able
to deal with messages from different threads.

Every `Pipeline` has one bus.

Note that a `Pipeline` will set its bus into flushing state when changing
from READY to NULL state.

# Implements

[`GstObjectExt`](trait.GstObjectExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- impl Bus::fn new -->
Creates a new `Bus` instance.

# Returns

a new `Bus` instance
<!-- impl Bus::fn add_signal_watch -->
Adds a bus signal watch to the default main context with the default priority
(`G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`). It is also possible to use a non-default
main context set up using `glib::MainContext::push_thread_default` (before
one had to create a bus watch source and attach it to the desired main
context 'manually').

After calling this statement, the bus will emit the "message" signal for each
message posted on the bus.

This function may be called multiple times. To clean up, the caller is
responsible for calling `Bus::remove_signal_watch` as many times as this
function is called.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn add_signal_watch_full -->
Adds a bus signal watch to the default main context with the given `priority`
(e.g. `G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`). It is also possible to use a non-default main
context set up using `glib::MainContext::push_thread_default`
(before one had to create a bus watch source and attach it to the desired
main context 'manually').

After calling this statement, the bus will emit the "message" signal for each
message posted on the bus when the main loop is running.

This function may be called multiple times. To clean up, the caller is
responsible for calling `Bus::remove_signal_watch` as many times as this
function is called.

There can only be a single bus watch per bus, you must remove any signal
watch before you can set another type of watch.

MT safe.
## `priority`
The priority of the watch.
<!-- impl Bus::fn add_watch -->
Adds a bus watch to the default main context with the default priority
(`G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`). It is also possible to use a non-default main
context set up using `glib::MainContext::push_thread_default` (before
one had to create a bus watch source and attach it to the desired main
context 'manually').

This function is used to receive asynchronous messages in the main loop.
There can only be a single bus watch per bus, you must remove it before you
can set a new one.

The bus watch will only work if a GLib main loop is being run.

The watch can be removed using `Bus::remove_watch` or by returning `false`
from `func`. If the watch was added to the default main context it is also
possible to remove the watch using `glib::Source::remove`.

The bus watch will take its own reference to the `self`, so it is safe to unref
`self` using `GstObjectExt::unref` after setting the bus watch.

MT safe.
## `func`
A function to call when a message is received.
## `user_data`
user data passed to `func`.

# Returns

The event source id or 0 if `self` already got an event source.
<!-- impl Bus::fn add_watch_full -->
Adds a bus watch to the default main context with the given `priority` (e.g.
`G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`). It is also possible to use a non-default main
context set up using `glib::MainContext::push_thread_default` (before
one had to create a bus watch source and attach it to the desired main
context 'manually').

This function is used to receive asynchronous messages in the main loop.
There can only be a single bus watch per bus, you must remove it before you
can set a new one.

The bus watch will only work if a GLib main loop is being run.

When `func` is called, the message belongs to the caller; if you want to
keep a copy of it, call `gst_message_ref` before leaving `func`.

The watch can be removed using `Bus::remove_watch` or by returning `false`
from `func`. If the watch was added to the default main context it is also
possible to remove the watch using `glib::Source::remove`.

The bus watch will take its own reference to the `self`, so it is safe to unref
`self` using `GstObjectExt::unref` after setting the bus watch.

MT safe.
## `priority`
The priority of the watch.
## `func`
A function to call when a message is received.
## `user_data`
user data passed to `func`.
## `notify`
the function to call when the source is removed.

# Returns

The event source id or 0 if `self` already got an event source.
<!-- impl Bus::fn async_signal_func -->

into signals.
## `message`
the `Message` received
## `data`
user data

# Returns

`true`
<!-- impl Bus::fn create_watch -->
Create watch for this bus. The GSource will be dispatched whenever
a message is on the bus. After the GSource is dispatched, the
message is popped off the bus and unreffed.

# Returns

a `glib::Source` that can be added to a mainloop.
<!-- impl Bus::fn disable_sync_message_emission -->
Instructs GStreamer to stop emitting the "sync-message" signal for this bus.
See `Bus::enable_sync_message_emission` for more information.

In the event that multiple pieces of code have called
`Bus::enable_sync_message_emission`, the sync-message emissions will only
be stopped after all calls to `Bus::enable_sync_message_emission` were
"cancelled" by calling this function. In this way the semantics are exactly
the same as `GstObjectExt::ref` that which calls enable should also call
disable.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn enable_sync_message_emission -->
Instructs GStreamer to emit the "sync-message" signal after running the bus's
sync handler. This function is here so that code can ensure that they can
synchronously receive messages without having to affect what the bin's sync
handler is.

This function may be called multiple times. To clean up, the caller is
responsible for calling `Bus::disable_sync_message_emission` as many times
as this function is called.

While this function looks similar to `Bus::add_signal_watch`, it is not
exactly the same -- this function enables `<emphasis>`synchronous`</emphasis>` emission of
signals when messages arrive; `Bus::add_signal_watch` adds an idle callback
to pop messages off the bus `<emphasis>`asynchronously`</emphasis>`. The sync-message signal
comes from the thread of whatever object posted the message; the "message"
signal is marshalled to the main thread via the main loop.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn get_pollfd -->
Gets the file descriptor from the bus which can be used to get notified about
messages being available with functions like `g_poll`, and allows integration
into other event loops based on file descriptors.
Whenever a message is available, the POLLIN / `glib::IOCondition::In` event is set.

Warning: NEVER read or write anything to the returned fd but only use it
for getting notifications via `g_poll` or similar and then use the normal
GstBus API, e.g. `Bus::pop`.

Feature: `v1_14`

## `fd`
A GPollFD to fill
<!-- impl Bus::fn have_pending -->
Check if there are pending messages on the bus that
should be handled.

# Returns

`true` if there are messages on the bus to be handled, `false`
otherwise.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn peek -->
Peek the message on the top of the bus' queue. The message will remain
on the bus' message queue. A reference is returned, and needs to be unreffed
by the caller.

# Returns

the `Message` that is on the
 bus, or `None` if the bus is empty.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn poll -->
Poll the bus for messages. Will block while waiting for messages to come.
You can specify a maximum time to poll with the `timeout` parameter. If
`timeout` is negative, this function will block indefinitely.

All messages not in `events` will be popped off the bus and will be ignored.
It is not possible to use message enums beyond `MessageType::Extended` in the
`events` mask

Because poll is implemented using the "message" signal enabled by
`Bus::add_signal_watch`, calling `Bus::poll` will cause the "message"
signal to be emitted for every message that poll sees. Thus a "message"
signal handler will see the same messages that this function sees -- neither
will steal messages from the other.

This function will run a main loop from the default main context when
polling.

You should never use this function, since it is pure evil. This is
especially true for GUI applications based on Gtk+ or Qt, but also for any
other non-trivial application that uses the GLib main loop. As this function
runs a GLib main loop, any callback attached to the default GLib main
context may be invoked. This could be timeouts, GUI events, I/O events etc.;
even if `Bus::poll` is called with a 0 timeout. Any of these callbacks
may do things you do not expect, e.g. destroy the main application window or
some other resource; change other application state; display a dialog and
run another main loop until the user clicks it away. In short, using this
function may add a lot of complexity to your code through unexpected
re-entrancy and unexpected changes to your application's state.

For 0 timeouts use `Bus::pop_filtered` instead of this function; for
other short timeouts use `Bus::timed_pop_filtered`; everything else is
better handled by setting up an asynchronous bus watch and doing things
from there.
## `events`
a mask of `MessageType`, representing the set of message types to
poll for (note special handling of extended message types below)
## `timeout`
the poll timeout, as a `ClockTime`, or `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE` to poll
indefinitely.

# Returns

the message that was received,
 or `None` if the poll timed out. The message is taken from the
 bus and needs to be unreffed with `gst_message_unref` after
 usage.
<!-- impl Bus::fn pop -->
Get a message from the bus.

# Returns

the `Message` that is on the
 bus, or `None` if the bus is empty. The message is taken from
 the bus and needs to be unreffed with `gst_message_unref` after
 usage.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn pop_filtered -->
Get a message matching `type_` from the bus. Will discard all messages on
the bus that do not match `type_` and that have been posted before the first
message that does match `type_`. If there is no message matching `type_` on
the bus, all messages will be discarded. It is not possible to use message
enums beyond `MessageType::Extended` in the `events` mask.
## `types`
message types to take into account

# Returns

the next `Message` matching
 `type_` that is on the bus, or `None` if the bus is empty or there
 is no message matching `type_`. The message is taken from the bus
 and needs to be unreffed with `gst_message_unref` after usage.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn post -->
Post a message on the given bus. Ownership of the message
is taken by the bus.
## `message`
the `Message` to post

# Returns

`true` if the message could be posted, `false` if the bus is flushing.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn remove_signal_watch -->
Removes a signal watch previously added with `Bus::add_signal_watch`.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn remove_watch -->
Removes an installed bus watch from `self`.

# Returns

`true` on success or `false` if `self` has no event source.
<!-- impl Bus::fn set_flushing -->
If `flushing`, flush out and unref any messages queued in the bus. Releases
references to the message origin objects. Will flush future messages until
`Bus::set_flushing` sets `flushing` to `false`.

MT safe.
## `flushing`
whether or not to flush the bus
<!-- impl Bus::fn set_sync_handler -->
Sets the synchronous handler on the bus. The function will be called
every time a new message is posted on the bus. Note that the function
will be called in the same thread context as the posting object. This
function is usually only called by the creator of the bus. Applications
should handle messages asynchronously using the gst_bus watch and poll
functions.

You cannot replace an existing sync_handler. You can pass `None` to this
function, which will clear the existing handler.
## `func`
The handler function to install
## `user_data`
User data that will be sent to the handler function.
## `notify`
called when `user_data` becomes unused
<!-- impl Bus::fn sync_signal_handler -->

messages into signals.
## `message`
the `Message` received
## `data`
user data

# Returns

GST_BUS_PASS
<!-- impl Bus::fn timed_pop -->
Get a message from the bus, waiting up to the specified timeout.

If `timeout` is 0, this function behaves like `Bus::pop`. If `timeout` is
`GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`, this function will block forever until a message was
posted on the bus.
## `timeout`
a timeout

# Returns

the `Message` that is on the
 bus after the specified timeout or `None` if the bus is empty
 after the timeout expired. The message is taken from the bus
 and needs to be unreffed with `gst_message_unref` after usage.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Bus::fn timed_pop_filtered -->
Get a message from the bus whose type matches the message type mask `types`,
waiting up to the specified timeout (and discarding any messages that do not
match the mask provided).

If `timeout` is 0, this function behaves like `Bus::pop_filtered`. If
`timeout` is `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`, this function will block forever until a
matching message was posted on the bus.
## `timeout`
a timeout in nanoseconds, or GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE to wait forever
## `types`
message types to take into account, GST_MESSAGE_ANY for any type

# Returns

a `Message` matching the
 filter in `types`, or `None` if no matching message was found on
 the bus until the timeout expired. The message is taken from
 the bus and needs to be unreffed with `gst_message_unref` after
 usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait BusExt::fn connect_message -->
A message has been posted on the bus. This signal is emitted from a
GSource added to the mainloop. this signal will only be emitted when
there is a mainloop running.
## `message`
the message that has been posted asynchronously
<!-- trait BusExt::fn connect_sync_message -->
A message has been posted on the bus. This signal is emitted from the
thread that posted the message so one has to be careful with locking.

This signal will not be emitted by default, you have to call
`Bus::enable_sync_message_emission` before.
## `message`
the message that has been posted synchronously
<!-- enum BusSyncReply -->
The result values for a GstBusSyncHandler.
<!-- enum BusSyncReply::variant Drop -->
drop the message
<!-- enum BusSyncReply::variant Pass -->
pass the message to the async queue
<!-- enum BusSyncReply::variant Async -->
pass message to async queue, continue if message is handled
<!-- struct Caps -->
Caps (capabilities) are lightweight refcounted objects describing media types.
They are composed of an array of `Structure`.

Caps are exposed on `PadTemplate` to describe all possible types a
given pad can handle. They are also stored in the `Registry` along with
a description of the `Element`.

Caps are exposed on the element pads using the `PadExt::query_caps` pad
function. This function describes the possible types that the pad can
handle or produce at runtime.

A `Caps` can be constructed with the following code fragment:

```C
  GstCaps *caps = gst_caps_new_simple ("video/x-raw",
     "format", G_TYPE_STRING, "I420",
     "framerate", GST_TYPE_FRACTION, 25, 1,
     "pixel-aspect-ratio", GST_TYPE_FRACTION, 1, 1,
     "width", G_TYPE_INT, 320,
     "height", G_TYPE_INT, 240,
     NULL);
```

A `Caps` is fixed when it has no properties with ranges or lists. Use
`Caps::is_fixed` to test for fixed caps. Fixed caps can be used in a
caps event to notify downstream elements of the current media type.

Various methods exist to work with the media types such as subtracting
or intersecting.

Be aware that the current `Caps` / `Structure` serialization into string
has limited support for nested `Caps` / `Structure` fields. It can only
support one level of nesting. Using more levels will lead to unexpected
behavior when using serialization features, such as `Caps::to_string` or
`gst_value_serialize` and their counterparts.

<!-- impl Caps::fn get_features -->
Finds the features in `self` that has the index `index`, and
returns it.

WARNING: This function takes a const GstCaps *, but returns a
non-const GstCapsFeatures *. This is for programming convenience --
the caller should be aware that structures inside a constant
`Caps` should not be modified. However, if you know the caps
are writable, either because you have just copied them or made
them writable with `gst_caps_make_writable`, you may modify the
features returned in the usual way, e.g. with functions like
`CapsFeatures::add`.

You do not need to free or unref the structure returned, it
belongs to the `Caps`.

<!-- impl Caps::fn simplify -->
Converts the given `self` into a representation that represents the
same set of formats, but in a simpler form. Component structures that are
identical are merged. Component structures that have values that can be
merged are also merged.

This function takes ownership of `self` and will call `gst_caps_make_writable`
on it if necessary, so you must not use `self` afterwards unless you keep an
additional reference to it with `gst_caps_ref`.

This method does not preserve the original order of `self`.

# Returns

The simplified caps.

> are included on one caps and omitted on the other.
## `subtrahend`
`Caps` to subtract

# Returns

the resulting caps
<!-- impl Caps::fn to_string -->
Converts `self` to a string representation. This string representation
can be converted back to a `Caps` by `Caps::from_string`.

For debugging purposes its easier to do something like this:

```C
GST_LOG ("caps are %" GST_PTR_FORMAT, caps);
```
This prints the caps in human readable form.

The current implementation of serialization will lead to unexpected results
when there are nested `Caps` / `Structure` deeper than one level.

# Returns

a newly allocated string representing `self`.
<!-- impl Caps::fn truncate -->
Discard all but the first structure from `self`. Useful when
fixating.

This function takes ownership of `self` and will call `gst_caps_make_writable`
on it if necessary, so you must not use `self` afterwards unless you keep an
additional reference to it with `gst_caps_ref`.

# Returns

truncated caps
<!-- impl Caps::fn from_string -->
Converts `caps` from a string representation.

The current implementation of serialization will lead to unexpected results
when there are nested `Caps` / `Structure` deeper than one level.

# Returns

a newly allocated `Caps`
<!-- enum CapsIntersectMode -->
Modes of caps intersection

`CapsIntersectMode::ZigZag` tries to preserve overall order of both caps
by iterating on the caps' structures as the following matrix shows:

```text
         caps1
      +-------------
      | 1  2  4  7
caps2 | 3  5  8 10
      | 6  9 11 12
```
Used when there is no explicit precedence of one caps over the other. e.g.
tee's sink pad getcaps function, it will probe its src pad peers' for their
caps and intersect them with this mode.

`CapsIntersectMode::First` is useful when an element wants to preserve
another element's caps priority order when intersecting with its own caps.
Example: If caps1 is [A, B, C] and caps2 is [E, B, D, A], the result
would be [A, B], maintaining the first caps priority on the intersection.
<!-- enum CapsIntersectMode::variant ZigZag -->
Zig-zags over both caps.
<!-- enum CapsIntersectMode::variant First -->
Keeps the first caps order.
<!-- struct ChildProxy -->
This interface abstracts handling of property sets for elements with
children. Imagine elements such as mixers or polyphonic generators. They all
have multiple `Pad` or some kind of voice objects. Another use case are
container elements like `Bin`.
The element implementing the interface acts as a parent for those child
objects.

By implementing this interface the child properties can be accessed from the
parent element by using `ChildProxy::get` and `ChildProxy::set`.

Property names are written as "child-name::property-name". The whole naming
scheme is recursive. Thus "child1::child2::property" is valid too, if
"child1" and "child2" implement the `ChildProxy` interface.

<!-- struct Clock -->
GStreamer uses a global clock to synchronize the plugins in a pipeline.
Different clock implementations are possible by implementing this abstract
base class or, more conveniently, by subclassing `SystemClock`.

The `Clock` returns a monotonically increasing time with the method
`ClockExt::get_time`. Its accuracy and base time depend on the specific
clock implementation but time is always expressed in nanoseconds. Since the
baseline of the clock is undefined, the clock time returned is not
meaningful in itself, what matters are the deltas between two clock times.
The time returned by a clock is called the absolute time.

The pipeline uses the clock to calculate the running time. Usually all
renderers synchronize to the global clock using the buffer timestamps, the
newsegment events and the element's base time, see `Pipeline`.

A clock implementation can support periodic and single shot clock
notifications both synchronous and asynchronous.

One first needs to create a `ClockID` for the periodic or single shot
notification using `ClockExt::new_single_shot_id` or
`ClockExt::new_periodic_id`.

To perform a blocking wait for the specific time of the `ClockID` use the
`Clock::id_wait`. To receive a callback when the specific time is reached
in the clock use `Clock::id_wait_async`. Both these calls can be
interrupted with the `Clock::id_unschedule` call. If the blocking wait is
unscheduled a return value of `ClockReturn::Unscheduled` is returned.

Periodic callbacks scheduled async will be repeatedly called automatically
until it is unscheduled. To schedule a sync periodic callback,
`Clock::id_wait` should be called repeatedly.

The async callbacks can happen from any thread, either provided by the core
or from a streaming thread. The application should be prepared for this.

A `ClockID` that has been unscheduled cannot be used again for any wait
operation, a new `ClockID` should be created and the old unscheduled one
should be destroyed with `Clock::id_unref`.

It is possible to perform a blocking wait on the same `ClockID` from
multiple threads. However, registering the same `ClockID` for multiple
async notifications is not possible, the callback will only be called for
the thread registering the entry last.

None of the wait operations unref the `ClockID`, the owner is responsible
for unreffing the ids itself. This holds for both periodic and single shot
notifications. The reason being that the owner of the `ClockID` has to
keep a handle to the `ClockID` to unblock the wait on FLUSHING events or
state changes and if the entry would be unreffed automatically, the handle
might become invalid without any notification.

These clock operations do not operate on the running time, so the callbacks
will also occur when not in PLAYING state as if the clock just keeps on
running. Some clocks however do not progress when the element that provided
the clock is not PLAYING.

When a clock has the `ClockFlags::CanSetMaster` flag set, it can be
slaved to another `Clock` with the `ClockExt::set_master`. The clock will
then automatically be synchronized to this master clock by repeatedly
sampling the master clock and the slave clock and recalibrating the slave
clock with `ClockExt::set_calibration`. This feature is mostly useful for
plugins that have an internal clock but must operate with another clock
selected by the `Pipeline`. They can track the offset and rate difference
of their internal clock relative to the master clock by using the
`ClockExt::get_calibration` function.

The master/slave synchronisation can be tuned with the `Clock:timeout`,
`Clock:window-size` and `Clock:window-threshold` properties.
The `Clock:timeout` property defines the interval to sample the master
clock and run the calibration functions. `Clock:window-size` defines the
number of samples to use when calibrating and `Clock:window-threshold`
defines the minimum number of samples before the calibration is performed.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Clock::fn id_unref -->
Unref given `id`. When the refcount reaches 0 the
`ClockID` will be freed.

MT safe.
## `id`
The `ClockID` to unref
<!-- impl Clock::fn id_unschedule -->
Cancel an outstanding request with `id`. This can either
be an outstanding async notification or a pending sync notification.
After this call, `id` cannot be used anymore to receive sync or
async notifications, you need to create a new `ClockID`.

MT safe.
## `id`
The id to unschedule
<!-- impl Clock::fn id_wait -->
Perform a blocking wait on `id`.
`id` should have been created with `ClockExt::new_single_shot_id`
or `ClockExt::new_periodic_id` and should not have been unscheduled
with a call to `Clock::id_unschedule`.

If the `jitter` argument is not `None` and this function returns `ClockReturn::Ok`
or `ClockReturn::Early`, it will contain the difference
against the clock and the time of `id` when this method was
called.
Positive values indicate how late `id` was relative to the clock
(in which case this function will return `ClockReturn::Early`).
Negative values indicate how much time was spent waiting on the clock
before this function returned.
## `id`
The `ClockID` to wait on
## `jitter`
a pointer that will contain the jitter,
 can be `None`.

# Returns

the result of the blocking wait. `ClockReturn::Early` will be returned
if the current clock time is past the time of `id`, `ClockReturn::Ok` if
`id` was scheduled in time. `ClockReturn::Unscheduled` if `id` was
unscheduled with `Clock::id_unschedule`.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Clock::fn id_wait_async -->
Register a callback on the given `ClockID` `id` with the given
function and user_data. When passing a `ClockID` with an invalid
time to this function, the callback will be called immediately
with a time set to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE. The callback will
be called when the time of `id` has been reached.

The callback `func` can be invoked from any thread, either provided by the
core or from a streaming thread. The application should be prepared for this.
## `id`
a `ClockID` to wait on
## `func`
The callback function
## `user_data`

MT safe.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn add_observation -->
The time `master` of the master clock and the time `slave` of the slave
clock are added to the list of observations. If enough observations
are available, a linear regression algorithm is run on the
observations and `self` is recalibrated.

If this functions returns `true`, `r_squared` will contain the
correlation coefficient of the interpolation. A value of 1.0
means a perfect regression was performed. This value can
be used to control the sampling frequency of the master and slave
clocks.
## `slave`

# Returns

the converted time of the clock.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn adjust_with_calibration -->
Converts the given `internal_target` clock time to the external time,
using the passed calibration parameters. This function performs the
same calculation as `ClockExt::adjust_unlocked` when called using the
current calibration parameters, but doesn't ensure a monotonically
increasing result as `ClockExt::adjust_unlocked` does.

caller is not interested in the values.

MT safe.
## `internal`

## `external`
a location to store the external time
## `rate_num`
a location to store the rate numerator
## `rate_denom`

<!-- trait ClockExt::fn get_internal_time -->
Gets the current internal time of the given clock. The time is returned
unadjusted for the offset and the rate.

# Returns

the internal time of the clock. Or GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE when
given invalid input.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn get_master -->
Get the master clock that `self` is slaved to or `None` when the clock is
not slaved to any master clock.

# Returns

a master `Clock` or `None`
 when this clock is not slaved to a master clock. Unref after
 usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn get_resolution -->

# Returns

`true` if the clock is currently synced
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn new_periodic_id -->
Get an ID from `self` to trigger a periodic notification.
The periodic notifications will start at time `start_time` and
will then be fired with the given `interval`. `id` should be unreffed
after usage.

Free-function: gst_clock_id_unref
## `start_time`
the requested start time
## `interval`
the requested interval

# Returns

a `ClockID` that can be used to request the
 time notification.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn new_single_shot_id -->
Get a `ClockID` from `self` to trigger a single shot
notification at the requested time. The single shot id should be
unreffed after usage.

Free-function: gst_clock_id_unref
## `time`

# Returns

a `ClockID` that can be used to request the
 time notification.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn periodic_id_reinit -->

interval. Does not modify the reference count.
## `id`
a `ClockID`
## `start_time`
the requested start time
## `interval`
the requested interval

# Returns

`true` if the GstClockID could be reinitialized to the provided
`time`, else `false`.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn set_calibration -->
Adjusts the rate and time of `self`. A rate of 1/1 is the normal speed of
the clock. Values bigger than 1/1 make the clock go faster.

`internal` and `external` are calibration parameters that arrange that
`ClockExt::get_time` should have been `external` at internal time `internal`.
This internal time should not be in the future; that is, it should be less
than the value of `ClockExt::get_internal_time` when this function is called.

Subsequent calls to `ClockExt::get_time` will return clock times computed as
follows:


```text
  time = (internal_time - internal) * rate_num / rate_denom + external
```

This formula is implemented in `ClockExt::adjust_unlocked`. Of course, it
tries to do the integer arithmetic as precisely as possible.

Note that `ClockExt::get_time` always returns increasing values so when you
move the clock backwards, `ClockExt::get_time` will report the previous value
until the clock catches up.

MT safe.
## `internal`
a reference internal time
## `external`
a reference external time
## `rate_num`
the numerator of the rate of the clock relative to its
 internal time
## `rate_denom`
the denominator of the rate of the clock
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn set_master -->
Set `master` as the master clock for `self`. `self` will be automatically
calibrated so that `ClockExt::get_time` reports the same time as the
master clock.

A clock provider that slaves its clock to a master can get the current
calibration values with `ClockExt::get_calibration`.

`master` can be `None` in which case `self` will not be slaved anymore. It will
however keep reporting its time adjusted with the last configured rate
and time offsets.
## `master`
a master `Clock`

# Returns

`true` if the clock is capable of being slaved to a master clock.
Trying to set a master on a clock without the
`ClockFlags::CanSetMaster` flag will make this function return `false`.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn set_resolution -->
Set the accuracy of the clock. Some clocks have the possibility to operate
with different accuracy at the expense of more resource usage. There is
normally no need to change the default resolution of a clock. The resolution
of a clock can only be changed if the clock has the
`ClockFlags::CanSetResolution` flag set.
## `resolution`
The resolution to set

# Returns

the new resolution of the clock.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn set_synced -->
Sets `self` to synced and emits the GstClock::synced signal, and wakes up any
thread waiting in `ClockExt::wait_for_sync`.

This function must only be called if GST_CLOCK_FLAG_NEEDS_STARTUP_SYNC
is set on the clock, and is intended to be called by subclasses only.
## `synced`
if the clock is synced
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn set_timeout -->
Set the amount of time, in nanoseconds, to sample master and slave
clocks
## `timeout`
a timeout
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn single_shot_id_reinit -->
Reinitializes the provided single shot `id` to the provided time. Does not
modify the reference count.
## `id`
a `ClockID`
## `time`
The requested time.

# Returns

`true` if the GstClockID could be reinitialized to the provided
`time`, else `false`.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn unadjust_unlocked -->
Converts the given `external` clock time to the internal time of `self`,
using the rate and reference time set with `ClockExt::set_calibration`.
This function should be called with the clock's OBJECT_LOCK held and
is mainly used by clock subclasses.

This function is the reverse of `ClockExt::adjust_unlocked`.
## `external`
an external clock time

# Returns

the internal time of the clock corresponding to `external`.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn unadjust_with_calibration -->
Converts the given `external_target` clock time to the internal time,
using the passed calibration parameters. This function performs the
same calculation as `ClockExt::unadjust_unlocked` when called using the
current calibration parameters.

Note: The `self` parameter is unused and can be NULL
## `external_target`
a clock time
## `cinternal`
a reference internal time
## `cexternal`
a reference external time
## `cnum`
the numerator of the rate of the clock relative to its
 internal time
## `cdenom`
the denominator of the rate of the clock

# Returns

the converted time of the clock.
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn wait_for_sync -->
Waits until `self` is synced for reporting the current time. If `timeout`
is `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE` it will wait forever, otherwise it will time out
after `timeout` nanoseconds.

For asynchronous waiting, the GstClock::synced signal can be used.

This returns immediately with TRUE if GST_CLOCK_FLAG_NEEDS_STARTUP_SYNC
is not set on the clock, or if the clock is already synced.
## `timeout`
timeout for waiting or `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`

# Returns

`true` if waiting was successful, or `false` on timeout
<!-- trait ClockExt::fn connect_synced -->
Signaled on clocks with GST_CLOCK_FLAG_NEEDS_STARTUP_SYNC set once
the clock is synchronized, or when it completely lost synchronization.
This signal will not be emitted on clocks without the flag.

This signal will be emitted from an arbitrary thread, most likely not
the application's main thread.
## `synced`
if the clock is synced now

<!-- struct Context -->
`Context` is a container object used to store contexts like a device
context, a display server connection and similar concepts that should
be shared between multiple elements.

Applications can set a context on a complete pipeline by using
`ElementExt::set_context`, which will then be propagated to all
child elements. Elements can handle these in `ElementClass.set_context`()
and merge them with the context information they already have.

When an element needs a context it will do the following actions in this
order until one step succeeds:
1. Check if the element already has a context
2. Query downstream with GST_QUERY_CONTEXT for the context
3. Query upstream with GST_QUERY_CONTEXT for the context
4. Post a GST_MESSAGE_NEED_CONTEXT message on the bus with the required
 context types and afterwards check if a usable context was set now
5. Create a context by itself and post a GST_MESSAGE_HAVE_CONTEXT message
 on the bus.

Bins will catch GST_MESSAGE_NEED_CONTEXT messages and will set any previously
known context on the element that asks for it if possible. Otherwise the
application should provide one if it can.

`Context`<!-- -->s can be persistent.
A persistent `Context` is kept in elements when they reach
`State::Null`, non-persistent ones will be removed.
Also, a non-persistent context won't override a previous persistent
context set to an element.

## `context_type`
Context type to check.

<!-- struct DateTime -->
Struct to store date, time and timezone information altogether.
`DateTime` is refcounted and immutable.

Date information is handled using the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

Provides basic creation functions and accessor functions to its fields.
<!-- impl DateTime::fn new -->

Note that `tzoffset` is a float and was chosen so for being able to handle
some fractional timezones, while it still keeps the readability of
representing it in hours for most timezones.

If value is -1 then all over value will be ignored. For example
if `month` == -1, then `DateTime` will created only for `year`. If
`day` == -1, then `DateTime` will created for `year` and `month` and

<!-- impl DateTime::fn unref -->
Atomically decrements the reference count of `self` by one. When the

<!-- enum DebugLevel -->
The level defines the importance of a debugging message. The more important a
message is, the greater the probability that the debugging system outputs it.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant None -->
No debugging level specified or desired. Used to deactivate
 debugging output.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Error -->
Error messages are to be used only when an error occurred
 that stops the application from keeping working correctly.
 An examples is gst_element_error, which outputs a message with this priority.
 It does not mean that the application is terminating as with g_error.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Warning -->
Warning messages are to inform about abnormal behaviour
 that could lead to problems or weird behaviour later on. An example of this
 would be clocking issues ("your computer is pretty slow") or broken input
 data ("Can't synchronize to stream.")
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Fixme -->
Fixme messages are messages that indicate that something
 in the executed code path is not fully implemented or handled yet. Note
 that this does not replace proper error handling in any way, the purpose
 of this message is to make it easier to spot incomplete/unfinished pieces
 of code when reading the debug log.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Info -->
Informational messages should be used to keep the developer
 updated about what is happening.
 Examples where this should be used are when a typefind function has
 successfully determined the type of the stream or when an mp3 plugin detects
 the format to be used. ("This file has mono sound.")
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Debug -->
Debugging messages should be used when something common
 happens that is not the expected default behavior, or something that's
 useful to know but doesn't happen all the time (ie. per loop iteration or
 buffer processed or event handled).
 An example would be notifications about state changes or receiving/sending
 of events.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Log -->
Log messages are messages that are very common but might be
 useful to know. As a rule of thumb a pipeline that is running as expected
 should never output anything else but LOG messages whilst processing data.
 Use this log level to log recurring information in chain functions and
 loop functions, for example.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Trace -->
Tracing-related messages.
 Examples for this are referencing/dereferencing of objects.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Memdump -->
memory dump messages are used to log (small) chunks of
 data as memory dumps in the log. They will be displayed as hexdump with
 ASCII characters.
<!-- enum DebugLevel::variant Count -->
The number of defined debugging levels.
<!-- struct Device -->
`Device` are objects representing a device, they contain
relevant metadata about the device, such as its class and the `Caps`
representing the media types it can produce or handle.

`Device` are created by `DeviceProvider` objects which can be
aggregated by `DeviceMonitor` objects.

function fails, then one must destroy the element and create a new one
using `DeviceExt::create_element`.

Note: This should only be implemented for elements can change their
device in the PLAYING state.
## `element`
a `Element`

# Returns

`true` if the element could be reconfigured to use this device,
`false` otherwise.
<!-- struct DeviceMonitor -->
Applications should create a `DeviceMonitor` when they want
to probe, list and monitor devices of a specific type. The
`DeviceMonitor` will create the appropriate
`DeviceProvider` objects and manage them. It will then post
messages on its `Bus` for devices that have been added and
removed.

The device monitor will monitor all devices matching the filters that
the application has set.

The basic use pattern of a device monitor is as follows:

```text
  static gboolean
  my_bus_func (GstBus * bus, GstMessage * message, gpointer user_data)
  {
     GstDevice *device;
     gchar *name;

     switch (GST_MESSAGE_TYPE (message)) {
       case GST_MESSAGE_DEVICE_ADDED:
         gst_message_parse_device_added (message, &device);
         name = gst_device_get_display_name (device);
         g_print("Device added: %s\n", name);
         g_free (name);
         gst_object_unref (device);
         break;
       case GST_MESSAGE_DEVICE_REMOVED:
         gst_message_parse_device_removed (message, &device);
         name = gst_device_get_display_name (device);
         g_print("Device removed: %s\n", name);
         g_free (name);
         gst_object_unref (device);
         break;
       default:
         break;
     }

     return G_SOURCE_CONTINUE;
  }

  GstDeviceMonitor *
  setup_raw_video_source_device_monitor (void) {
     GstDeviceMonitor *monitor;
     GstBus *bus;
     GstCaps *caps;

     monitor = gst_device_monitor_new ();

     bus = gst_device_monitor_get_bus (monitor);
     gst_bus_add_watch (bus, my_bus_func, NULL);
     gst_object_unref (bus);

     caps = gst_caps_new_empty_simple ("video/x-raw");
     gst_device_monitor_add_filter (monitor, "Video/Source", caps);
     gst_caps_unref (caps);

     gst_device_monitor_start (monitor);

     return monitor;

Create a new `DeviceMonitor`

# Returns

a new device monitor.
<!-- trait DeviceMonitorExt::fn add_filter -->
Adds a filter for which `Device` will be monitored, any device that matches
all these classes and the `Caps` will be returned.

If this function is called multiple times to add more filters, each will be
matched independently. That is, adding more filters will not further restrict
what devices are matched.

The `Caps` supported by the device as returned by `DeviceExt::get_caps` are
not intersected with caps filters added using this function.

Filters must be added before the `DeviceMonitor` is started.
## `classes`
device classes to use as filter or `None` for any class
## `caps`
the `Caps` to filter or `None` for ANY

# Returns

The id of the new filter or 0 if no provider matched the filter's
 classes.

# Returns

`true` of the filter id was valid, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait DeviceMonitorExt::fn set_show_all_devices -->
Set if all devices should be visible, even those devices from hidden
providers. Setting `show_all` to true might show some devices multiple times.
## `show_all`
show all devices
<!-- trait DeviceMonitorExt::fn start -->
Starts monitoring the devices, one this has succeeded, the
`MessageType::DeviceAdded` and `MessageType::DeviceRemoved` messages
will be emitted on the bus when the list of devices changes.

# Returns

`true` if the device monitoring could be started
<!-- trait DeviceMonitorExt::fn stop -->
Stops monitoring the devices.
<!-- struct DeviceProvider -->
A `DeviceProvider` subclass is provided by a plugin that handles devices
if there is a way to programatically list connected devices. It can also
optionally provide updates to the list of connected devices.

Each `DeviceProvider` subclass is a singleton, a plugin should
normally provide a single subclass for all devices.

Applications would normally use a `DeviceMonitor` to monitor devices
from all relevant providers.

# Implements

[`DeviceProviderExt`](trait.DeviceProviderExt.html), [`GstObjectExt`](trait.GstObjectExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt -->
Trait containing all `DeviceProvider` methods.

# Implementors

[`DeviceProvider`](struct.DeviceProvider.html)
<!-- impl DeviceProvider::fn register -->
Create a new device providerfactory capable of instantiating objects of the
`type_` and add the factory to `plugin`.
## `plugin`
`Plugin` to register the device provider with, or `None` for
 a static device provider.
## `name`
name of device providers of this type
## `rank`
rank of device provider (higher rank means more importance when autoplugging)
## `type_`
GType of device provider to register

# Returns

`true`, if the registering succeeded, `false` on error
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn device_add -->
Posts a message on the provider's `Bus` to inform applications that
a new device has been added.

This is for use by subclasses.

`device`'s reference count will be incremented, and any floating reference
will be removed (see `Object::ref_sink`).
## `device`
a `Device` that has been added
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn device_remove -->
Posts a message on the provider's `Bus` to inform applications that
a device has been removed.

This is for use by subclasses.
## `device`
a `Device` that has been removed
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn get_bus -->
Gets the `Bus` of this `DeviceProvider`

# Returns

a `Bus`
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn get_devices -->

probe the hardware if the provider is not currently started.

# Returns

a `glib::List` of
 `Device`
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn get_factory -->

## `key`
the key to get

# Returns

the metadata for `key`.
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn hide_provider -->
Make `self` hide the devices from the factory with `name`.

This function is used when `self` will also provide the devices reported
by provider factory `name`. A monitor should stop monitoring the
device provider with `name` to avoid duplicate devices.
## `name`
a provider factory name
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn start -->
Starts providering the devices. This will cause `MessageType::DeviceAdded`
and `MessageType::DeviceRemoved` messages to be posted on the provider's bus
when devices are added or removed from the system.

Since the `DeviceProvider` is a singleton,
`DeviceProviderExt::start` may already have been called by another
user of the object, `DeviceProviderExt::stop` needs to be called the same
number of times.

# Returns

`true` if the device providering could be started
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn stop -->
Decreases the use-count by one. If the use count reaches zero, this
`DeviceProvider` will stop providering the devices. This needs to be
called the same number of times that `DeviceProviderExt::start` was called.
<!-- trait DeviceProviderExt::fn unhide_provider -->
Make `self` unhide the devices from factory `name`.

This function is used when `self` will no longer provide the devices
reported by provider factory `name`. A monitor should start
monitoring the devices from provider factory `name` in order to see
all devices again.
## `name`
a provider factory name
<!-- struct DeviceProviderFactory -->
`DeviceProviderFactory` is used to create instances of device providers. A
GstDeviceProviderfactory can be added to a `Plugin` as it is also a
`PluginFeature`.

Use the `DeviceProviderFactory::find` and
`DeviceProviderFactory::get` functions to create device
provider instances or use `DeviceProviderFactory::get_by_name` as a
convenient shortcut.

<!-- impl DeviceProviderFactory::fn get_metadata -->
Get the metadata on `self` with `key`.
## `key`

a `None` terminated array
 of classes to match, only match if all classes are matched

# Returns

`true` if `self` matches.
<!-- struct Element -->
GstElement is the abstract base class needed to construct an element that
can be used in a GStreamer pipeline. Please refer to the plugin writers
guide for more information on creating `Element` subclasses.

The name of a `Element` can be get with `gst_element_get_name` and set with
`gst_element_set_name`. For speed, GST_ELEMENT_NAME() can be used in the
core when using the appropriate locking. Do not use this in plug-ins or
applications in order to retain ABI compatibility.

Elements can have pads (of the type `Pad`). These pads link to pads on
other elements. `Buffer` flow between these linked pads.
A `Element` has a `glib::List` of `Pad` structures for all their input (or sink)
and output (or source) pads.
Core and plug-in writers can add and remove pads with `ElementExt::add_pad`
and `ElementExt::remove_pad`.

An existing pad of an element can be retrieved by name with
`ElementExt::get_static_pad`. A new dynamic pad can be created using
`ElementExt::request_pad` with a `PadTemplate`.
An iterator of all pads can be retrieved with `ElementExt::iterate_pads`.

Elements can be linked through their pads.
If the link is straightforward, use the `ElementExt::link`
convenience function to link two elements, or `ElementExt::link_many`
for more elements in a row.
Use `ElementExt::link_filtered` to link two elements constrained by
a specified set of `Caps`.
For finer control, use `ElementExt::link_pads` and
`ElementExt::link_pads_filtered` to specify the pads to link on
each element by name.

Each element has a state (see `State`). You can get and set the state
of an element with `ElementExt::get_state` and `ElementExt::set_state`.
Setting a state triggers a `StateChange`. To get a string representation
of a `State`, use `Element::state_get_name`.

You can get and set a `Clock` on an element using `ElementExt::get_clock`
and `ElementExt::set_clock`.
Some elements can provide a clock for the pipeline if
the `ElementFlags::ProvideClock` flag is set. With the
`ElementExt::provide_clock` method one can retrieve the clock provided by
such an element.
Not all elements require a clock to operate correctly. If the
`ElementFlags::RequireClock`() flag is set, a clock should be set on the
element with `ElementExt::set_clock`.

Note that clock selection and distribution is normally handled by the
toplevel `Pipeline` so the clock functions are only to be used in very
specific situations.

Abort the state change of the element. This function is used
by elements that do asynchronous state changes and find out
something is wrong.

This function should be called with the STATE_LOCK held.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn add_pad -->
Adds a pad (link point) to `self`. `pad`'s parent will be set to `self`;
see `GstObjectExt::set_parent` for refcounting information.

Pads are not automatically activated so elements should perform the needed
steps to activate the pad in case this pad is added in the PAUSED or PLAYING
state. See `PadExt::set_active` for more information about activating pads.

The pad and the element should be unlocked when calling this function.

This function will emit the `Element::pad-added` signal on the element.
## `pad`
the `Pad` to add to the element.

# Returns

`true` if the pad could be added. This function can fail when
a pad with the same name already existed or the pad already had another

<!-- trait ElementExt::fn call_async -->
Calls `func` from another thread and passes `user_data` to it. This is to be
used for cases when a state change has to be performed from a streaming
thread, directly via `ElementExt::set_state` or indirectly e.g. via SEEK
events.

Calling those functions directly from the streaming thread will cause
deadlocks in many situations, as they might involve waiting for the
streaming thread to shut down from this very streaming thread.

MT safe.

Feature: `v1_10`

## `func`
Function to call asynchronously from another thread
## `user_data`
Data to pass to `func`
## `destroy_notify`

# Returns

the `StateChangeReturn` of the state transition.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn continue_state -->
Commit the state change of the element and proceed to the next
pending state if any. This function is used
by elements that do asynchronous state changes.
The core will normally call this method automatically when an
element returned `StateChangeReturn::Success` from the state change function.

If after calling this method the element still has not reached
the pending state, the next state change is performed.

This method is used internally and should normally not be called by plugins
or applications.

This function must be called with STATE_LOCK held.
## `ret`
The previous state return value

# Returns

The result of the commit state change.

<!-- trait ElementExt::fn create_all_pads -->
Creates a pad for each pad template that is always available.
This function is only useful during object initialization of
subclasses of `Element`.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn foreach_pad -->
Call `func` with `user_data` for each of `self`'s pads. `func` will be called
exactly once for each pad that exists at the time of this call, unless
one of the calls to `func` returns `false` in which case we will stop
iterating pads and return early. If new pads are added or pads are removed
while pads are being iterated, this will not be taken into account until
next time this function is used.

## `func`
function to call for each pad
## `user_data`
user data passed to `func`

# Returns

`false` if `self` had no pads or if one of the calls to `func`
 returned `false`.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn foreach_sink_pad -->
Call `func` with `user_data` for each of `self`'s sink pads. `func` will be
called exactly once for each sink pad that exists at the time of this call,
unless one of the calls to `func` returns `false` in which case we will stop
iterating pads and return early. If new sink pads are added or sink pads
are removed while the sink pads are being iterated, this will not be taken
into account until next time this function is used.

called exactly once for each source pad that exists at the time of this call,
unless one of the calls to `func` returns `false` in which case we will stop
iterating pads and return early. If new source pads are added or source pads
are removed while the source pads are being iterated, this will not be taken
into account until next time this function is used.

Feature: `v1_14`

## `func`
function to call for each source pad
## `user_data`
user data passed to `func`

# Returns

`false` if `self` had no source pads or if one of the calls
 to `func` returned `false`.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_base_time -->
Returns the base time of the element. The base time is the
absolute time of the clock when this element was last put to
PLAYING. Subtracting the base time from the clock time gives
the running time of the element.

# Returns

the base time of the element.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_bus -->
Returns the bus of the element. Note that only a `Pipeline` will provide a
bus for the application.

# Returns

the element's `Bus`. unref after
usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_clock -->
Gets the currently configured clock of the element. This is the clock as was
last set with `ElementExt::set_clock`.

Elements in a pipeline will only have their clock set when the
pipeline is in the PLAYING state.

# Returns

the `Clock` of the element. unref after usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_compatible_pad -->
Looks for an unlinked pad to which the given pad can link. It is not
guaranteed that linking the pads will work, though it should work in most
cases.

This function will first attempt to find a compatible unlinked ALWAYS pad,
and if none can be found, it will request a compatible REQUEST pad by looking
at the templates of `self`.
## `pad`
the `Pad` to find a compatible one for.
## `caps`
the `Caps` to use as a filter.

# Returns

the `Pad` to which a link
 can be made, or `None` if one cannot be found. `GstObjectExt::unref`
 after usage.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_compatible_pad_template -->
Retrieves a pad template from `self` that is compatible with `compattempl`.
Pads from compatible templates can be linked together.

Feature: `v1_14`

## `key`
the key to get

# Returns

the metadata for `key`.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_pad_template -->
Retrieves a padtemplate from `self` with the given name.

Feature: `v1_14`

## `name`
the name of the `PadTemplate` to get.

# Returns

the `PadTemplate` with the
 given name, or `None` if none was found. No unreferencing is
 necessary.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_pad_template_list -->
Retrieves a list of the pad templates associated with `self`. The
list must not be modified by the calling code.

Feature: `v1_14`


# Returns

the `glib::List` of
 pad templates.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_request_pad -->
Retrieves a pad from the element by name (e.g. "src_\%d"). This version only
retrieves request pads. The pad should be released with
`ElementExt::release_request_pad`.

This method is slower than manually getting the pad template and calling
`ElementExt::request_pad` if the pads should have a specific name (e.g.
`name` is "src_1" instead of "src_\%u").
## `name`
the name of the request `Pad` to retrieve.

# Returns

requested `Pad` if found,
 otherwise `None`. Release after usage.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_start_time -->
Returns the start time of the element. The start time is the
running time of the clock when this element was last put to PAUSED.

Usually the start_time is managed by a toplevel element such as
`Pipeline`.

MT safe.

# Returns

the start time of the element.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_state -->
Gets the state of the element.

For elements that performed an ASYNC state change, as reported by
`ElementExt::set_state`, this function will block up to the
specified timeout value for the state change to complete.
If the element completes the state change or goes into
an error, this function returns immediately with a return value of
`StateChangeReturn::Success` or `StateChangeReturn::Failure` respectively.

For elements that did not return `StateChangeReturn::Async`, this function
returns the current and pending state immediately.

This function returns `StateChangeReturn::NoPreroll` if the element
successfully changed its state but is not able to provide data yet.
This mostly happens for live sources that only produce data in
`State::Playing`. While the state change return is equivalent to
`StateChangeReturn::Success`, it is returned to the application to signal that
some sink elements might not be able to complete their state change because
an element is not producing data to complete the preroll. When setting the
element to playing, the preroll will complete and playback will start.
## `state`
a pointer to `State` to hold the state.
 Can be `None`.
## `pending`
a pointer to `State` to hold the pending
 state. Can be `None`.
## `timeout`
a `ClockTime` to specify the timeout for an async
 state change or `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE` for infinite timeout.

# Returns

`StateChangeReturn::Success` if the element has no more pending state
 and the last state change succeeded, `StateChangeReturn::Async` if the
 element is still performing a state change or
 `StateChangeReturn::Failure` if the last state change failed.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn get_static_pad -->
Retrieves a pad from `self` by name. This version only retrieves
already-existing (i.e. 'static') pads.
## `name`
the name of the static `Pad` to retrieve.

# Returns

the requested `Pad` if
 found, otherwise `None`. unref after usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn is_locked_state -->
Checks if the state of an element is locked.
If the state of an element is locked, state changes of the parent don't
affect the element.
This way you can leave currently unused elements inside bins. Just lock their
state before changing the state from `State::Null`.

MT safe.

# Returns

`true`, if the element's state is locked.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn iterate_pads -->
Retrieves an iterator of `self`'s pads. The iterator should
be freed after usage. Also more specialized iterators exists such as
`ElementExt::iterate_src_pads` or `ElementExt::iterate_sink_pads`.

The order of pads returned by the iterator will be the order in which
the pads were added to the element.

# Returns

the `Iterator` of `Pad`.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn iterate_sink_pads -->
Retrieves an iterator of `self`'s sink pads.

The order of pads returned by the iterator will be the order in which
the pads were added to the element.

# Returns

the `Iterator` of `Pad`.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn iterate_src_pads -->
Retrieves an iterator of `self`'s source pads.

The order of pads returned by the iterator will be the order in which
the pads were added to the element.

# Returns

the `Iterator` of `Pad`.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn link -->
Links `self` to `dest`. The link must be from source to
destination; the other direction will not be tried. The function looks for
existing pads that aren't linked yet. It will request new pads if necessary.
Such pads need to be released manually when unlinking.
If multiple links are possible, only one is established.

Make sure you have added your elements to a bin or pipeline with
`BinExt::add` before trying to link them.
## `dest`
the `Element` containing the destination pad.

# Returns

`true` if the elements could be linked, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn link_filtered -->
Links `self` to `dest` using the given caps as filtercaps.
The link must be from source to
destination; the other direction will not be tried. The function looks for
existing pads that aren't linked yet. It will request new pads if necessary.
If multiple links are possible, only one is established.

Make sure you have added your elements to a bin or pipeline with
`BinExt::add` before trying to link them.
## `dest`
the `Element` containing the destination pad.
## `filter`
the `Caps` to filter the link,
 or `None` for no filter.

# Returns

`true` if the pads could be linked, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn link_many -->
Chain together a series of elements. Uses `ElementExt::link`.
Make sure you have added your elements to a bin or pipeline with
`BinExt::add` before trying to link them.
## `element_2`
the second `Element` in the link chain.

# Returns

`true` on success, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn link_pads -->
Links the two named pads of the source and destination elements.
Side effect is that if one of the pads has no parent, it becomes a
child of the parent of the other element. If they have different
parents, the link fails.
## `srcpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in source element
 or `None` for any pad.
## `dest`
the `Element` containing the destination pad.
## `destpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in destination element,
or `None` for any pad.

# Returns

`true` if the pads could be linked, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn link_pads_filtered -->
Links the two named pads of the source and destination elements. Side effect
is that if one of the pads has no parent, it becomes a child of the parent of
the other element. If they have different parents, the link fails. If `caps`
is not `None`, makes sure that the caps of the link is a subset of `caps`.
## `srcpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in source element
 or `None` for any pad.
## `dest`
the `Element` containing the destination pad.
## `destpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in destination element
 or `None` for any pad.
## `filter`
the `Caps` to filter the link,
 or `None` for no filter.

# Returns

`true` if the pads could be linked, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn link_pads_full -->
Links the two named pads of the source and destination elements.
Side effect is that if one of the pads has no parent, it becomes a
child of the parent of the other element. If they have different
parents, the link fails.

Calling `ElementExt::link_pads_full` with `flags` == `PadLinkCheck::Default`
is the same as calling `ElementExt::link_pads` and the recommended way of
linking pads with safety checks applied.

This is a convenience function for `PadExt::link_full`.
## `srcpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in source element
 or `None` for any pad.
## `dest`
the `Element` containing the destination pad.
## `destpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in destination element,
or `None` for any pad.
## `flags`
the `PadLinkCheck` to be performed when linking pads.

# Returns

`true` if the pads could be linked, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn lost_state -->
Brings the element to the lost state. The current state of the
element is copied to the pending state so that any call to
`ElementExt::get_state` will return `StateChangeReturn::Async`.

An ASYNC_START message is posted. If the element was PLAYING, it will
go to PAUSED. The element will be restored to its PLAYING state by
the parent pipeline when it prerolls again.

This is mostly used for elements that lost their preroll buffer
in the `State::Paused` or `State::Playing` state after a flush,
they will go to their pending state again when a new preroll buffer is
queued. This function can only be called when the element is currently
not in error or an async state change.

This function is used internally and should normally not be called from
plugins or applications.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn message_full -->
Post an error, warning or info message on the bus from inside an element.

`type_` must be of `MessageType::Error`, `MessageType::Warning` or
`MessageType::Info`.

 used as a replacement for the default debugging information,
 or `None`
## `file`
the source code file where the error was generated
## `function`

the source code line where the error was generated
## `structure`
optional details structure
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn no_more_pads -->
Use this function to signal that the element does not expect any more pads
to show up in the current pipeline. This function should be called whenever
pads have been added by the element itself. Elements with `PadPresence::Sometimes`
pad templates use this in combination with autopluggers to figure out that
the element is done initializing its pads.

This function emits the `Element::no-more-pads` signal.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn post_message -->
Post a message on the element's `Bus`. This function takes ownership of the
message; if you want to access the message after this call, you should add an
additional reference before calling.
## `message`
a `Message` to post

# Returns

`true` if the message was successfully posted. The function returns
`false` if the element did not have a bus.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn provide_clock -->
Get the clock provided by the given element.
> An element is only required to provide a clock in the PAUSED
> state. Some elements can provide a clock in other states.

# Returns

the GstClock provided by the
element or `None` if no clock could be provided. Unref after usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn query -->
Performs a query on the given element.

For elements that don't implement a query handler, this function
forwards the query to a random srcpad or to the peer of a
random linked sinkpad of this element.

Please note that some queries might need a running pipeline to work.
## `query`
the `Query`.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn query_convert -->
Queries an element to convert `src_val` in `src_format` to `dest_format`.
## `src_format`
a `Format` to convert from.
## `src_val`
a value to convert.
## `dest_format`
the `Format` to convert to.
## `dest_val`
a pointer to the result.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn query_duration -->
Queries an element (usually top-level pipeline or playbin element) for the
total stream duration in nanoseconds. This query will only work once the
pipeline is prerolled (i.e. reached PAUSED or PLAYING state). The application
will receive an ASYNC_DONE message on the pipeline bus when that is the case.

If the duration changes for some reason, you will get a DURATION_CHANGED
message on the pipeline bus, in which case you should re-query the duration
using this function.
## `format`
the `Format` requested
## `duration`
A location in which to store the total duration, or `None`.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn query_position -->
Queries an element (usually top-level pipeline or playbin element) for the
stream position in nanoseconds. This will be a value between 0 and the
stream duration (if the stream duration is known). This query will usually
only work once the pipeline is prerolled (i.e. reached PAUSED or PLAYING
state). The application will receive an ASYNC_DONE message on the pipeline
bus when that is the case.

If one repeatedly calls this function one can also create a query and reuse
it in `Element::query`.
## `format`
the `Format` requested
## `cur`
a location in which to store the current
 position, or `None`.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn release_request_pad -->
Makes the element free the previously requested pad as obtained
with `ElementExt::request_pad`.

This does not unref the pad. If the pad was created by using
`ElementExt::request_pad`, `ElementExt::release_request_pad` needs to be
followed by `GstObjectExt::unref` to free the `pad`.

MT safe.
## `pad`
the `Pad` to release.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn remove_pad -->
Removes `pad` from `self`. `pad` will be destroyed if it has not been
referenced elsewhere using `GstObjectExt::unparent`.

This function is used by plugin developers and should not be used
by applications. Pads that were dynamically requested from elements
with `ElementExt::request_pad` should be released with the
`ElementExt::release_request_pad` function instead.

Pads are not automatically deactivated so elements should perform the needed
steps to deactivate the pad in case this pad is removed in the PAUSED or
PLAYING state. See `PadExt::set_active` for more information about
deactivating pads.

The pad and the element should be unlocked when calling this function.

This function will emit the `Element::pad-removed` signal on the element.
## `pad`
the `Pad` to remove from the element.

# Returns

`true` if the pad could be removed. Can return `false` if the
pad does not belong to the provided element.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn remove_property_notify_watch -->

Feature: `v1_10`

## `watch_id`
watch id to remove
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn request_pad -->
Retrieves a request pad from the element according to the provided template.
Pad templates can be looked up using
`ElementFactory::get_static_pad_templates`.

The pad should be released with `ElementExt::release_request_pad`.
## `templ`

## `name`
the name of the request `Pad`
to retrieve. Can be `None`.
## `caps`
the caps of the pad we want to
request. Can be `None`.

# Returns

requested `Pad` if found,
 otherwise `None`. Release after usage.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn seek -->
Sends a seek event to an element. See `Event::new_seek` for the details of
the parameters. The seek event is sent to the element using
`Element::send_event`.

MT safe.
## `rate`
The new playback rate
## `format`
The format of the seek values
## `flags`
The optional seek flags.
## `start_type`
The type and flags for the new start position
## `start`
The value of the new start position
## `stop_type`
The type and flags for the new stop position
## `stop`
The value of the new stop position

# Returns

`true` if the event was handled. Flushing seeks will trigger a
preroll, which will emit `MessageType::AsyncDone`.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn seek_simple -->
Simple API to perform a seek on the given element, meaning it just seeks
to the given position relative to the start of the stream. For more complex
operations like segment seeks (e.g. for looping) or changing the playback
rate or seeking relative to the last configured playback segment you should
use `Element::seek`.

In a completely prerolled PAUSED or PLAYING pipeline, seeking is always
guaranteed to return `true` on a seekable media type or `false` when the media
type is certainly not seekable (such as a live stream).

Some elements allow for seeking in the READY state, in this
case they will store the seek event and execute it when they are put to
PAUSED. If the element supports seek in READY, it will always return `true` when
it receives the event in the READY state.
## `format`
a `Format` to execute the seek in, such as `Format::Time`
## `seek_flags`
seek options; playback applications will usually want to use
 GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH | GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT here
## `seek_pos`
position to seek to (relative to the start); if you are doing
 a seek in `Format::Time` this value is in nanoseconds -
 multiply with `GST_SECOND` to convert seconds to nanoseconds or
 with `GST_MSECOND` to convert milliseconds to nanoseconds.

# Returns

`true` if the seek operation succeeded. Flushing seeks will trigger a
preroll, which will emit `MessageType::AsyncDone`.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn send_event -->
Sends an event to an element. If the element doesn't implement an
event handler, the event will be pushed on a random linked sink pad for
downstream events or a random linked source pad for upstream events.

This function takes ownership of the provided event so you should
`gst_event_ref` it if you want to reuse the event after this call.

MT safe.
## `event`
the `Event` to send to the element.

# Returns

`true` if the event was handled. Events that trigger a preroll (such
as flushing seeks and steps) will emit `MessageType::AsyncDone`.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn set_base_time -->
Set the base time of an element. See `ElementExt::get_base_time`.

MT safe.
## `time`
the base time to set.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn set_bus -->
Sets the bus of the element. Increases the refcount on the bus.
For internal use only, unless you're testing elements.

MT safe.
## `bus`
the `Bus` to set.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn set_clock -->
Sets the clock for the element. This function increases the
refcount on the clock. Any previously set clock on the object
is unreffed.
## `clock`
the `Clock` to set for the element.

# Returns

`true` if the element accepted the clock. An element can refuse a
clock when it, for example, is not able to slave its internal clock to the
`clock` or when it requires a specific clock to operate.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn set_context -->
Sets the context of the element. Increases the refcount of the context.

MT safe.
## `context`
the `Context` to set.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn set_locked_state -->
Locks the state of an element, so state changes of the parent don't affect
this element anymore.

MT safe.
## `locked_state`
`true` to lock the element's state

# Returns

`true` if the state was changed, `false` if bad parameters were given
or the elements state-locking needed no change.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn set_start_time -->
Set the start time of an element. The start time of the element is the
running time of the element when it last went to the PAUSED state. In READY
or after a flushing seek, it is set to 0.

Toplevel elements like `Pipeline` will manage the start_time and
base_time on its children. Setting the start_time to `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`
on such a toplevel element will disable the distribution of the base_time to
the children and can be useful if the application manages the base_time
itself, for example if you want to synchronize capture from multiple
pipelines, and you can also ensure that the pipelines have the same clock.

MT safe.
## `time`
the base time to set.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn set_state -->
Sets the state of the element. This function will try to set the
requested state by going through all the intermediary states and calling
the class's state change function for each.

This function can return `StateChangeReturn::Async`, in which case the
element will perform the remainder of the state change asynchronously in
another thread.
An application can use `ElementExt::get_state` to wait for the completion
of the state change or it can wait for a `MessageType::AsyncDone` or
`MessageType::StateChanged` on the bus.

State changes to `State::Ready` or `State::Null` never return
`StateChangeReturn::Async`.
## `state`
the element's new `State`.

# Returns

Result of the state change using `StateChangeReturn`.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn sync_state_with_parent -->
Tries to change the state of the element to the same as its parent.
If this function returns `false`, the state of element is undefined.

# Returns

`true`, if the element's state could be synced to the parent's state.

MT safe.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn unlink -->
Unlinks all source pads of the source element with all sink pads
of the sink element to which they are linked.

If the link has been made using `ElementExt::link`, it could have created an
requestpad, which has to be released using `ElementExt::release_request_pad`.
## `dest`
the sink `Element` to unlink.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn unlink_many -->
Unlinks a series of elements. Uses `ElementExt::unlink`.
## `element_2`
the second `Element` in the link chain.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn unlink_pads -->
Unlinks the two named pads of the source and destination elements.

This is a convenience function for `PadExt::unlink`.
## `srcpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in source element.
## `dest`
a `Element` containing the destination pad.
## `destpadname`
the name of the `Pad` in destination element.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn connect_no_more_pads -->
This signals that the element will not generate more dynamic pads.
Note that this signal will usually be emitted from the context of
the streaming thread.
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn connect_pad_added -->
a new `Pad` has been added to the element. Note that this signal will
usually be emitted from the context of the streaming thread. Also keep in
mind that if you add new elements to the pipeline in the signal handler
you will need to set them to the desired target state with
`ElementExt::set_state` or `ElementExt::sync_state_with_parent`.
## `new_pad`
the pad that has been added
<!-- trait ElementExt::fn connect_pad_removed -->
a `Pad` has been removed from the element
## `old_pad`
the pad that has been removed
<!-- struct ElementFactory -->
`ElementFactory` is used to create instances of elements. A
GstElementFactory can be added to a `Plugin` as it is also a
`PluginFeature`.

Use the `ElementFactory::find` and `ElementFactory::create`
functions to create element instances or use `ElementFactory::make` as a
convenient shortcut.

The following code example shows you how to create a GstFileSrc element.

## Using an element factory

```C
  #include &lt;gst/gst.h&gt;

  GstElement *src;
  GstElementFactory *srcfactory;

  gst_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  srcfactory = gst_element_factory_find ("filesrc");
  g_return_if_fail (srcfactory != NULL);
  src = gst_element_factory_create (srcfactory, "src");
  g_return_if_fail (src != NULL);
  ...
```

<!-- struct Event -->
The event class provides factory methods to construct events for sending
and functions to query (parse) received events.

Events are usually created with gst_event_new_*() which takes event-type
specific parameters as arguments.
To send an event application will usually use `Element::send_event` and
elements will use `Pad::send_event` or `Pad::push_event`.
The event should be unreffed with `gst_event_unref` if it has not been sent.

Events that have been received can be parsed with their respective
gst_event_parse_*() functions. It is valid to pass `None` for unwanted details.

Events are passed between elements in parallel to the data stream. Some events
are serialized with buffers, others are not. Some events only travel downstream,
others only upstream. Some events can travel both upstream and downstream.

The events are used to signal special conditions in the datastream such as
EOS (end of stream) or the start of a new stream-segment.
Events are also used to flush the pipeline of any pending data.

Most of the event API is used inside plugins. Applications usually only
construct and use seek events.
To do that `Event::new_seek` is used to create a seek event. It takes
the needed parameters to specify seeking time and mode.

```C
  GstEvent *event;
  gboolean result;
  ...
  // construct a seek event to play the media from second 2 to 5, flush
  // the pipeline to decrease latency.
  event = gst_event_new_seek (1.0,
     GST_FORMAT_TIME,
     GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH,
     GST_SEEK_TYPE_SET, 2 * GST_SECOND,
     GST_SEEK_TYPE_SET, 5 * GST_SECOND);
  ...
  result = gst_element_send_event (pipeline, event);
  if (!result)
    g_warning ("seek failed");
  ...
```
<!-- impl Event::fn new_buffer_size -->
Create a new buffersize event. The event is sent downstream and notifies
elements that they should provide a buffer of the specified dimensions.

When the `async` flag is set, a thread boundary is preferred.
## `format`
buffer format
## `minsize`
minimum buffer size
## `maxsize`
maximum buffer size
## `async`
thread behavior

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_caps -->
Create a new CAPS event for `caps`. The caps event can only travel downstream
synchronized with the buffer flow and contains the format of the buffers
that will follow after the event.
## `caps`
a `Caps`

# Returns

the new CAPS event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_custom -->
Create a new custom-typed event. This can be used for anything not
handled by other event-specific functions to pass an event to another
element.

Make sure to allocate an event type with the `GST_EVENT_MAKE_TYPE` macro,
assigning a free number and filling in the correct direction and
serialization flags.

New custom events can also be created by subclassing the event type if
needed.
## `type_`
The type of the new event
## `structure`
the structure for the event. The event will
 take ownership of the structure.

# Returns

the new custom event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_eos -->
Create a new EOS event. The eos event can only travel downstream
synchronized with the buffer flow. Elements that receive the EOS
event on a pad can return `FlowReturn::Eos` as a `FlowReturn`
when data after the EOS event arrives.

The EOS event will travel down to the sink elements in the pipeline
which will then post the `MessageType::Eos` on the bus after they have
finished playing any buffered data.

When all sinks have posted an EOS message, an EOS message is
forwarded to the application.

The EOS event itself will not cause any state transitions of the pipeline.

# Returns

the new EOS event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_flush_start -->
Allocate a new flush start event. The flush start event can be sent
upstream and downstream and travels out-of-bounds with the dataflow.

It marks pads as being flushing and will make them return
`FlowReturn::Flushing` when used for data flow with `Pad::push`,
`Pad::chain`, `Pad::get_range` and `Pad::pull_range`.
Any event (except a `EventType::FlushStop`) received
on a flushing pad will return `false` immediately.

Elements should unlock any blocking functions and exit their streaming
functions as fast as possible when this event is received.

This event is typically generated after a seek to flush out all queued data
in the pipeline so that the new media is played as soon as possible.

# Returns

a new flush start event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_flush_stop -->
Allocate a new flush stop event. The flush stop event can be sent
upstream and downstream and travels serialized with the dataflow.
It is typically sent after sending a FLUSH_START event to make the
pads accept data again.

Elements can process this event synchronized with the dataflow since
the preceding FLUSH_START event stopped the dataflow.

This event is typically generated to complete a seek and to resume
dataflow.
## `reset_time`
if time should be reset

# Returns

a new flush stop event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_gap -->
Create a new GAP event. A gap event can be thought of as conceptually
equivalent to a buffer to signal that there is no data for a certain
amount of time. This is useful to signal a gap to downstream elements
which may wait for data, such as muxers or mixers or overlays, especially
for sparse streams such as subtitle streams.
## `timestamp`
the start time (pts) of the gap
## `duration`
the duration of the gap

# Returns

the new GAP event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_latency -->
Create a new latency event. The event is sent upstream from the sinks and
notifies elements that they should add an additional `latency` to the
running time before synchronising against the clock.

The latency is mostly used in live sinks and is always expressed in
the time format.
## `latency`
the new latency value

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_navigation -->
Create a new navigation event from the given description.
## `structure`
description of the event. The event will take
 ownership of the structure.

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_protection -->
Creates a new event containing information specific to a particular
protection system (uniquely identified by `system_id`), by which that
protection system can acquire key(s) to decrypt a protected stream.

In order for a decryption element to decrypt media
protected using a specific system, it first needs all the
protection system specific information necessary to acquire the decryption
key(s) for that stream. The functions defined here enable this information
to be passed in events from elements that extract it
(e.g., ISOBMFF demuxers, MPEG DASH demuxers) to protection decrypter
elements that use it.

Events containing protection system specific information are created using
`Event::new_protection`, and they can be parsed by downstream elements
using `Event::parse_protection`.

In Common Encryption, protection system specific information may be located
within ISOBMFF files, both in movie (moov) boxes and movie fragment (moof)
boxes; it may also be contained in ContentProtection elements within MPEG
DASH MPDs. The events created by `Event::new_protection` contain data
identifying from which of these locations the encapsulated protection system
specific information originated. This origin information is required as
some protection systems use different encodings depending upon where the
information originates.

The events returned by `Event::new_protection` are implemented
in such a way as to ensure that the most recently-pushed protection info
event of a particular `origin` and `system_id` will
be stuck to the output pad of the sending element.
## `system_id`
a string holding a UUID that uniquely
identifies a protection system.
## `data`
a `Buffer` holding protection system specific
information. The reference count of the buffer will be incremented by one.
## `origin`
a string indicating where the protection
information carried in the event was extracted from. The allowed values
of this string will depend upon the protection scheme.

# Returns

a `EventType::Protection` event, if successful; `None`
if unsuccessful.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_qos -->
Allocate a new qos event with the given values.
The QOS event is generated in an element that wants an upstream
element to either reduce or increase its rate because of
high/low CPU load or other resource usage such as network performance or
throttling. Typically sinks generate these events for each buffer
they receive.

`type_` indicates the reason for the QoS event. `QOSType::Overflow` is
used when a buffer arrived in time or when the sink cannot keep up with
the upstream datarate. `QOSType::Underflow` is when the sink is not
receiving buffers fast enough and thus has to drop late buffers.
`QOSType::Throttle` is used when the datarate is artificially limited
by the application, for example to reduce power consumption.

`proportion` indicates the real-time performance of the streaming in the
element that generated the QoS event (usually the sink). The value is
generally computed based on more long term statistics about the streams
timestamps compared to the clock.
A value < 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is producing data faster
than real-time. A value > 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is not
producing data fast enough. 1.0 is the ideal `proportion` value. The
proportion value can safely be used to lower or increase the quality of
the element.

`diff` is the difference against the clock in running time of the last
buffer that caused the element to generate the QOS event. A negative value
means that the buffer with `timestamp` arrived in time. A positive value
indicates how late the buffer with `timestamp` was. When throttling is
enabled, `diff` will be set to the requested throttling interval.

`timestamp` is the timestamp of the last buffer that cause the element
to generate the QOS event. It is expressed in running time and thus an ever
increasing value.

The upstream element can use the `diff` and `timestamp` values to decide
whether to process more buffers. For positive `diff`, all buffers with
timestamp <= `timestamp` + `diff` will certainly arrive late in the sink
as well. A (negative) `diff` value so that `timestamp` + `diff` would yield a
result smaller than 0 is not allowed.

The application can use general event probes to intercept the QoS
event and implement custom application specific QoS handling.
## `type_`
the QoS type
## `proportion`
the proportion of the qos message
## `diff`
The time difference of the last Clock sync
## `timestamp`
The timestamp of the buffer

# Returns

a new QOS event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_reconfigure -->
Create a new reconfigure event. The purpose of the reconfigure event is
to travel upstream and make elements renegotiate their caps or reconfigure
their buffer pools. This is useful when changing properties on elements
or changing the topology of the pipeline.

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_seek -->
Allocate a new seek event with the given parameters.

The seek event configures playback of the pipeline between `start` to `stop`
at the speed given in `rate`, also called a playback segment.
The `start` and `stop` values are expressed in `format`.

A `rate` of 1.0 means normal playback rate, 2.0 means double speed.
Negatives values means backwards playback. A value of 0.0 for the
rate is not allowed and should be accomplished instead by PAUSING the
pipeline.

A pipeline has a default playback segment configured with a start
position of 0, a stop position of -1 and a rate of 1.0. The currently
configured playback segment can be queried with `QueryType::Segment`.

`start_type` and `stop_type` specify how to adjust the currently configured
start and stop fields in playback segment. Adjustments can be made relative
or absolute to the last configured values. A type of `SeekType::None`
means that the position should not be updated.

When the rate is positive and `start` has been updated, playback will start
from the newly configured start position.

For negative rates, playback will start from the newly configured stop
position (if any). If the stop position is updated, it must be different from
-1 (`GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`) for negative rates.

It is not possible to seek relative to the current playback position, to do
this, PAUSE the pipeline, query the current playback position with
`QueryType::Position` and update the playback segment current position with a
`SeekType::Set` to the desired position.
## `rate`
The new playback rate
## `format`
The format of the seek values
## `flags`
The optional seek flags
## `start_type`
The type and flags for the new start position
## `start`
The value of the new start position
## `stop_type`
The type and flags for the new stop position
## `stop`
The value of the new stop position

# Returns

a new seek event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_segment -->
Create a new SEGMENT event for `segment`. The segment event can only travel
downstream synchronized with the buffer flow and contains timing information
and playback properties for the buffers that will follow.

The segment event marks the range of buffers to be processed. All
data not within the segment range is not to be processed. This can be
used intelligently by plugins to apply more efficient methods of skipping
unneeded data. The valid range is expressed with the `start` and `stop`
values.

The time value of the segment is used in conjunction with the start
value to convert the buffer timestamps into the stream time. This is
usually done in sinks to report the current stream_time.
`time` represents the stream_time of a buffer carrying a timestamp of
`start`. `time` cannot be -1.

`start` cannot be -1, `stop` can be -1. If there
is a valid `stop` given, it must be greater or equal the `start`, including
when the indicated playback `rate` is < 0.

The `applied_rate` value provides information about any rate adjustment that
has already been made to the timestamps and content on the buffers of the
stream. (`rate` * `applied_rate`) should always equal the rate that has been
requested for playback. For example, if an element has an input segment
with intended playback `rate` of 2.0 and applied_rate of 1.0, it can adjust
incoming timestamps and buffer content by half and output a segment event
with `rate` of 1.0 and `applied_rate` of 2.0

After a segment event, the buffer stream time is calculated with:

 time + (TIMESTAMP(buf) - start) * ABS (rate * applied_rate)
## `segment`
a `Segment`

# Returns

the new SEGMENT event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_segment_done -->
Create a new segment-done event. This event is sent by elements that
finish playback of a segment as a result of a segment seek.
## `format`
The format of the position being done
## `position`
The position of the segment being done

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_select_streams -->
Allocate a new select-streams event.

The select-streams event requests the specified `streams` to be activated.

The list of `streams` corresponds to the "Stream ID" of each stream to be
activated. Those ID can be obtained via the `Stream` objects present
in `EventType::StreamStart`, `EventType::StreamCollection` or
`MessageType::StreamCollection`.

Note: The list of `streams` can not be empty.

Feature: `v1_10`

## `streams`
the list of streams to
activate

# Returns

a new select-streams event or `None` in case of
an error (like an empty streams list).
<!-- impl Event::fn new_sink_message -->
Create a new sink-message event. The purpose of the sink-message event is
to instruct a sink to post the message contained in the event synchronized
with the stream.

`name` is used to store multiple sticky events on one pad.
## `name`
a name for the event
## `msg`
the `Message` to be posted

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_step -->
Create a new step event. The purpose of the step event is to instruct a sink
to skip `amount` (expressed in `format`) of media. It can be used to implement
stepping through the video frame by frame or for doing fast trick modes.

A rate of <= 0.0 is not allowed. Pause the pipeline, for the effect of rate
= 0.0 or first reverse the direction of playback using a seek event to get
the same effect as rate < 0.0.

The `flush` flag will clear any pending data in the pipeline before starting
the step operation.

The `intermediate` flag instructs the pipeline that this step operation is
part of a larger step operation.
## `format`
the format of `amount`
## `amount`
the amount of data to step
## `rate`
the step rate
## `flush`
flushing steps
## `intermediate`
intermediate steps

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_stream_collection -->
Create a new STREAM_COLLECTION event. The stream collection event can only
travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow.

Source elements, demuxers and other elements that manage collections
of streams and post `StreamCollection` messages on the bus also send
this event downstream on each pad involved in the collection, so that
activation of a new collection can be tracked through the downstream
data flow.

Feature: `v1_10`

## `collection`
Active collection for this data flow

# Returns

the new STREAM_COLLECTION event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_stream_group_done -->
Create a new Stream Group Done event. The stream-group-done event can
only travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow. Elements
that receive the event on a pad should handle it mostly like EOS,
and emit any data or pending buffers that would depend on more data
arriving and unblock, since there won't be any more data.

This event is followed by EOS at some point in the future, and is
generally used when switching pads - to unblock downstream so that
new pads can be exposed before sending EOS on the existing pads.

Feature: `v1_10`

## `group_id`
the group id of the stream group which is ending

# Returns

the new stream-group-done event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_stream_start -->
Create a new STREAM_START event. The stream start event can only
travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow. It is expected
to be the first event that is sent for a new stream.

Source elements, demuxers and other elements that create new streams
are supposed to send this event as the first event of a new stream. It
should not be sent after a flushing seek or in similar situations
and is used to mark the beginning of a new logical stream. Elements
combining multiple streams must ensure that this event is only forwarded
downstream once and not for every single input stream.

The `stream_id` should be a unique string that consists of the upstream
stream-id, / as separator and a unique stream-id for this specific
stream. A new stream-id should only be created for a stream if the upstream
stream is split into (potentially) multiple new streams, e.g. in a demuxer,
but not for every single element in the pipeline.
`PadExt::create_stream_id` or `PadExt::create_stream_id_printf` can be
used to create a stream-id. There are no particular semantics for the
stream-id, though it should be deterministic (to support stream matching)
and it might be used to order streams (besides any information conveyed by
stream flags).
## `stream_id`
Identifier for this stream

# Returns

the new STREAM_START event.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_tag -->
Generates a metadata tag event from the given `taglist`.

The scope of the taglist specifies if the taglist applies to the
complete medium or only to this specific stream. As the tag event
is a sticky event, elements should merge tags received from
upstream with a given scope with their own tags with the same
scope and create a new tag event from it.
## `taglist`
metadata list. The event will take ownership
 of the taglist.

# Returns

a new `Event`
<!-- impl Event::fn new_toc -->
Generate a TOC event from the given `toc`. The purpose of the TOC event is to
inform elements that some kind of the TOC was found.
## `toc`
`Toc` structure.
## `updated`
whether `toc` was updated or not.

# Returns

a new `Event`.
<!-- impl Event::fn new_toc_select -->
Generate a TOC select event with the given `uid`. The purpose of the
TOC select event is to start playback based on the TOC's entry with the
given `uid`.
## `uid`
UID in the TOC to start playback from.

# Returns

a new `Event`.
<!-- impl Event::fn copy_segment -->
Parses a segment `self` and copies the `Segment` into the location
given by `segment`.
## `segment`
a pointer to a `Segment`
<!-- impl Event::fn get_running_time_offset -->
Retrieve the accumulated running time offset of the event.

Events passing through `GstPads` that have a running time
offset set via `PadExt::set_offset` will get their offset
adjusted according to the pad's offset.

If the event contains any information that related to the
running time, this information will need to be updated
before usage with this offset.

# Returns

The event's running time offset

MT safe.
<!-- impl Event::fn get_seqnum -->
Retrieve the sequence number of a event.

Events have ever-incrementing sequence numbers, which may also be set
explicitly via `Event::set_seqnum`. Sequence numbers are typically used to
indicate that a event corresponds to some other set of events or messages,
for example an EOS event corresponding to a SEEK event. It is considered good
practice to make this correspondence when possible, though it is not
required.

Note that events and messages share the same sequence number incrementor;
two events or messages will never have the same sequence number unless
that correspondence was made explicitly.

# Returns

The event's sequence number.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Event::fn get_structure -->
Access the structure of the event.

# Returns

The structure of the event. The
structure is still owned by the event, which means that you should not free
it and that the pointer becomes invalid when you free the event.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Event::fn has_name -->
Checks if `self` has the given `name`. This function is usually used to
check the name of a custom event.
## `name`
name to check

# Returns

`true` if `name` matches the name of the event structure.

 the gap, or `None`
<!-- impl Event::fn parse_group_id -->
## `group_id`

## `latency`
A pointer to store the latency in.
<!-- impl Event::fn parse_protection -->

holding protection system specific information.
## `origin`
pointer to store a value that
indicates where the protection information carried by `self` was extracted
from.

## `proportion`
A pointer to store the proportion in
## `diff`
A pointer to store the diff in
## `timestamp`
A pointer to store the timestamp in

<!-- struct GhostPad -->
GhostPads are useful when organizing pipelines with `Bin` like elements.
The idea here is to create hierarchical element graphs. The bin element
contains a sub-graph. Now one would like to treat the bin-element like any
other `Element`. This is where GhostPads come into play. A GhostPad acts as
a proxy for another pad. Thus the bin can have sink and source ghost-pads
that are associated with sink and source pads of the child elements.

If the target pad is known at creation time, `GhostPad::new` is the
function to use to get a ghost-pad. Otherwise one can use `GhostPad::new_no_target`
to create the ghost-pad and use `GhostPadExt::set_target` to establish the
association later on.

Note that GhostPads add overhead to the data processing of a pipeline.

<!-- struct Message -->
Messages are implemented as a subclass of `MiniObject` with a generic
`Structure` as the content. This allows for writing custom messages without
requiring an API change while allowing a wide range of different types
of messages.

Messages are posted by objects in the pipeline and are passed to the
application using the `Bus`.

The basic use pattern of posting a message on a `Bus` is as follows:

```C
  gst_bus_post (bus, gst_message_new_eos());
```

A `Element` usually posts messages on the bus provided by the parent
container using `ElementExt::post_message`.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_application -->
Create a new application-typed message. GStreamer will never create these
messages; they are a gift from us to you. Enjoy.
## `src`

 will take ownership of the structure.

# Returns

The new application message.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_async_done -->
The message is posted when elements completed an ASYNC state change.
`running_time` contains the time of the desired running_time when this
elements goes to PLAYING. A value of `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE` for `running_time`
means that the element has no clock interaction and thus doesn't care about
the running_time of the pipeline.
## `src`
The object originating the message.
## `running_time`

# Returns

The new async_done message.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_async_start -->

## `src`
The object originating the message.

# Returns

The new async_start message.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_buffering -->
Create a new buffering message. This message can be posted by an element that
needs to buffer data before it can continue processing. `percent` should be a
value between 0 and 100. A value of 100 means that the buffering completed.

When `percent` is < 100 the application should PAUSE a PLAYING pipeline. When
`percent` is 100, the application can set the pipeline (back) to PLAYING.
The application must be prepared to receive BUFFERING messages in the
PREROLLING state and may only set the pipeline to PLAYING after receiving a
message with `percent` set to 100, which can happen after the pipeline
completed prerolling.

MT safe.
## `src`
The object originating the message.
## `percent`
The buffering percent

# Returns

The new buffering message.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_clock_lost -->
Create a clock lost message. This message is posted whenever the

## `src`
The object originating the message.
## `clock`
the clock that was lost

# Returns

The new clock lost message.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_clock_provide -->

<!-- impl Message::fn new_qos -->
A QOS message is posted on the bus whenever an element decides to drop a
buffer because of QoS reasons or whenever it changes its processing strategy
because of QoS reasons (quality adjustments such as processing at lower
accuracy).

This message can be posted by an element that performs synchronisation against the
clock (live) or it could be dropped by an element that performs QoS because of QOS
events received from a downstream element (!live).

`running_time`, `stream_time`, `timestamp`, `duration` should be set to the
respective running-time, stream-time, timestamp and duration of the (dropped)
buffer that generated the QoS event. Values can be left to
GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE when unknown.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_redirect -->
Creates a new redirect message and adds a new entry to it. Redirect messages
are posted when an element detects that the actual data has to be retrieved
from a different location. This is useful if such a redirection cannot be
handled inside a source element, for example when HTTP 302/303 redirects
return a non-HTTP URL.

The redirect message can hold multiple entries. The first one is added
when the redirect message is created, with the given location, tag_list,
entry_struct arguments. Use `Message::add_redirect_entry` to add more
entries.

Each entry has a location, a tag list, and a structure. All of these are
optional. The tag list and structure are useful for additional metadata,
such as bitrate statistics for the given location.

By default, message recipients should treat entries in the order they are
stored. The recipient should therefore try entry `0` first, and if this
entry is not acceptable or working, try entry `1` etc. Senders must make
sure that they add entries in this order. However, recipients are free to
ignore the order and pick an entry that is "best" for them. One example
would be a recipient that scans the entries for the one with the highest
bitrate tag.

The specified location string is copied. However, ownership over the tag
list and structure are transferred to the message.

Feature: `v1_10`

## `src`
The `Object` whose property changed (may or may not be a `Element`)
## `location`
location string for the new entry
## `tag_list`
tag list for the new entry
## `entry_struct`
structure for the new entry

# Returns

a newly allocated `Message`
<!-- impl Message::fn new_request_state -->

pipeline because a higher priority stream is being played.
## `src`
The object originating the message.
## `state`
The new requested state

# Returns

the new request state message.

MT safe.

the requested running-time

# Returns

The new reset_time message.

MT safe.
<!-- impl Message::fn new_segment_done -->

have posted the segment_done.
## `src`
The object originating the message.
## `format`
The format of the position being done
## `position`
The position of the segment being done

# Returns

the new segment done message.

<!-- struct Object -->
`Object` provides a root for the object hierarchy tree filed in by the
GStreamer library. It is currently a thin wrapper on top of
`gobject::InitiallyUnowned`. It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own.

`Object` gives us basic refcounting, parenting functionality and locking.
Most of the functions are just extended for special GStreamer needs and can be
found under the same name in the base class of `Object` which is `gobject::Object`
(e.g. `gobject::ObjectExt::ref` becomes `GstObjectExt::ref`).

Since `Object` derives from `gobject::InitiallyUnowned`, it also inherits the
floating reference. Be aware that functions such as `BinExt::add` and
`ElementExt::add_pad` take ownership of the floating reference.

In contrast to `gobject::Object` instances, `Object` adds a name property. The functions
`GstObjectExt::set_name` and `GstObjectExt::get_name` are used to set/get the name
of the object.

## controlled properties

Controlled properties offers a lightweight way to adjust gobject properties
over stream-time. It works by using time-stamped value pairs that are queued
for element-properties. At run-time the elements continuously pull value
changes for the current stream-time.

What needs to be changed in a `Element`?
Very little - it is just two steps to make a plugin controllable!

 * mark gobject-properties paramspecs that make sense to be controlled,
 by GST_PARAM_CONTROLLABLE.

 * when processing data (get, chain, loop function) at the beginning call
 gst_object_sync_values(element,timestamp).
 This will make the controller update all GObject properties that are
 under its control with the current values based on the timestamp.

What needs to be done in applications? Again it's not a lot to change.

 * create a `ControlSource`.
 csource = gst_interpolation_control_source_new ();
 g_object_set (csource, "mode", GST_INTERPOLATION_MODE_LINEAR, NULL);

 * Attach the `ControlSource` on the controller to a property.
 gst_object_add_control_binding (object, gst_direct_control_binding_new (object, "prop1", csource));

 * Set the control values
 gst_timed_value_control_source_set ((GstTimedValueControlSource *)csource,0 * GST_SECOND, value1);
 gst_timed_value_control_source_set ((GstTimedValueControlSource *)csource,1 * GST_SECOND, value2);

 * start your pipeline

 a set of user-specified properties to exclude or `None` to show
 all changes.
<!-- impl Object::fn ref_sink -->
Increase the reference count of `object`, and possibly remove the floating
reference, if `object` has a floating reference.

In other words, if the object is floating, then this call "assumes ownership"
of the floating reference, converting it to a normal reference by clearing
the floating flag while leaving the reference count unchanged. If the object
is not floating, then this call adds a new normal reference increasing the
reference count by one.

For more background on "floating references" please see the `gobject::Object`
documentation.
## `object`
a `Object` to sink
<!-- impl Object::fn replace -->
Atomically modifies a pointer to point to a new object.
The reference count of `oldobj` is decreased and the reference count of
`newobj` is increased.

Either `newobj` and the value pointed to by `oldobj` may be `None`.
## `oldobj`
pointer to a place of
 a `Object` to replace
## `newobj`
a new `Object`

# Returns

`true` if `newobj` was different from `oldobj`
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn add_control_binding -->
Attach the `ControlBinding` to the object. If there already was a
`ControlBinding` for this property it will be replaced.

The object's reference count will be incremented, and any floating
reference will be removed (see `Object::ref_sink`)

`false` if the given `binding` has not been setup for this object or
has been setup for a non suitable property, `true` otherwise.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn default_error -->
A default error function that uses `g_printerr` to display the error message
and the optional debug sting..

The default handler will simply print the error string using g_print.
## `error`
the GError.
## `debug`
an additional debug information string, or `None`
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn get_control_binding -->

the `ControlBinding` for
`property_name` or `None` if the property is not controlled.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn get_control_rate -->
Obtain the control-rate for this `self`. Audio processing `Element`
objects will use this rate to sub-divide their processing loop and call
`GstObjectExt::sync_values` inbetween. The length of the processing segment
should be up to `control`-rate nanoseconds.

If the `self` is not under property control, this will return
`GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`. This allows the element to avoid the sub-dividing.

The control-rate is not expected to change if the element is in
`State::Paused` or `State::Playing`.

# Returns

the control rate in nanoseconds
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn get_g_value_array -->

Caller should `g_free` the return value after usage.
For a nameless object, this returns `None`, which you can safely `g_free`
as well.

Free-function: g_free

# Returns

the name of `self`. `g_free`
after usage.

MT safe. This function grabs and releases `self`'s LOCK.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn get_parent -->

curve or apply a control curve sample by sample.

The values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function
`GstObjectExt::get_g_value_array` returns the array as `GValues` and is
better suites for bindings.
## `property_name`
the name of the property to get
## `timestamp`
the time that should be processed
## `interval`
the time spacing between subsequent values
## `n_values`
the number of values

 the parent of `self`. Otherwise `false`.

MT safe. Grabs and releases `self`'s locks.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn ref -->
Increments the reference count on `self`. This function
does not take the lock on `self` because it relies on
atomic refcounting.

This object returns the input parameter to ease writing
constructs like :
 result = gst_object_ref (object->parent);

# Returns

A pointer to `self`
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn remove_control_binding -->
Removes the corresponding `ControlBinding`. If it was the
last ref of the binding, it will be disposed.
## `binding`

Change the control-rate for this `self`. Audio processing `Element`
objects will use this rate to sub-divide their processing loop and call
`GstObjectExt::sync_values` inbetween. The length of the processing segment
should be up to `control`-rate nanoseconds.

The control-rate should not change if the element is in `State::Paused` or
`State::Playing`.
## `control_rate`
the new control-rate in nanoseconds.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn set_name -->
Sets the name of `self`, or gives `self` a guaranteed unique
name (if `name` is `None`).
This function makes a copy of the provided name, so the caller
retains ownership of the name it sent.
## `name`
new name of object

# Returns

`true` if the name could be set. Since Objects that have
a parent cannot be renamed, this function returns `false` in those
cases.

MT safe. This function grabs and releases `self`'s LOCK.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn set_parent -->
Sets the parent of `self` to `parent`. The object's reference count will
be incremented, and any floating reference will be removed (see `Object::ref_sink`).
## `parent`
new parent of object

# Returns

`true` if `parent` could be set or `false` when `self`
already had a parent or `self` and `parent` are the same.

MT safe. Grabs and releases `self`'s LOCK.

# Returns

`true` if the controller values could be applied to the object
properties, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn unparent -->
Clear the parent of `self`, removing the associated reference.
This function decreases the refcount of `self`.

MT safe. Grabs and releases `self`'s lock.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn unref -->
Decrements the reference count on `self`. If reference count hits
zero, destroy `self`. This function does not take the lock
on `self` as it relies on atomic refcounting.

The unref method should never be called with the LOCK held since
this might deadlock the dispose function.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn connect_deep_notify -->
The deep notify signal is used to be notified of property changes. It is
typically attached to the toplevel bin to receive notifications from all
the elements contained in that bin.
## `prop_object`
the object that originated the signal
## `prop`
the property that changed
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn get_property_parent -->
The parent of the object. Please note, that when changing the 'parent'
property, we don't emit `gobject::Object::notify` and `Object::deep-notify`
signals due to locking issues. In some cases one can use
`Bin::element-added` or `Bin::element-removed` signals on the parent to
achieve a similar effect.
<!-- trait GstObjectExt::fn set_property_parent -->
The parent of the object. Please note, that when changing the 'parent'
property, we don't emit `gobject::Object::notify` and `Object::deep-notify`
signals due to locking issues. In some cases one can use
`Bin::element-added` or `Bin::element-removed` signals on the parent to
achieve a similar effect.
<!-- struct Pad -->
A `Element` is linked to other elements via "pads", which are extremely
light-weight generic link points.

Pads have a `PadDirection`, source pads produce data, sink pads consume
data.

Pads are typically created from a `PadTemplate` with
`Pad::new_from_template` and are then added to a `Element`. This usually
happens when the element is created but it can also happen dynamically based
on the data that the element is processing or based on the pads that the
application requests.

Pads without pad templates can be created with `Pad::new`,
which takes a direction and a name as an argument. If the name is `None`,
then a guaranteed unique name will be assigned to it.

A `Element` creating a pad will typically use the various
gst_pad_set_*`_function` calls to register callbacks for events, queries or
dataflow on the pads.

`gst_pad_get_parent` will retrieve the `Element` that owns the pad.

After two pads are retrieved from an element by `ElementExt::get_static_pad`,
the pads can be linked with `PadExt::link`. (For quick links,
you can also use `ElementExt::link`, which will make the obvious
link for you if it's straightforward.). Pads can be unlinked again with
`PadExt::unlink`. `PadExt::get_peer` can be used to check what the pad is
linked to.

Before dataflow is possible on the pads, they need to be activated with
`PadExt::set_active`.

`Pad::query` and `Pad::peer_query` can be used to query various
properties of the pad and the stream.

To send a `Event` on a pad, use `Pad::send_event` and
`Pad::push_event`. Some events will be sticky on the pad, meaning that
after they pass on the pad they can be queried later with
`PadExt::get_sticky_event` and `PadExt::sticky_events_foreach`.
`PadExt::get_current_caps` and `PadExt::has_current_caps` are convenience
functions to query the current sticky CAPS event on a pad.

GstElements will use `Pad::push` and `Pad::pull_range` to push out
or pull in a buffer.

The dataflow, events and queries that happen on a pad can be monitored with
probes that can be installed with `PadExt::add_probe`. `PadExt::is_blocked`
can be used to check if a block probe is installed on the pad.
`PadExt::is_blocking` checks if the blocking probe is currently blocking the
pad. `Pad::remove_probe` is used to remove a previously installed probe
and unblock blocking probes if any.

Pad have an offset that can be retrieved with `PadExt::get_offset`. This
offset will be applied to the running_time of all data passing over the pad.
`PadExt::set_offset` can be used to change the offset.

Convenience functions exist to start, pause and stop the task on a pad with
`PadExt::start_task`, `PadExt::pause_task` and `PadExt::stop_task`
respectively.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn add_probe -->
Be notified of different states of pads. The provided callback is called for
every state that matches `mask`.

Probes are called in groups: First GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BLOCK probes are
called, then others, then finally GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_IDLE. The only
exception here are GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_IDLE probes that are called
immediately if the pad is already idle while calling `PadExt::add_probe`.
In each of the groups, probes are called in the order in which they were
added.

<!-- trait PadExt::fn chain -->
Chain a buffer to `self`.

The function returns `FlowReturn::Flushing` if the pad was flushing.

If the buffer type is not acceptable for `self` (as negotiated with a
preceding GST_EVENT_CAPS event), this function returns
`FlowReturn::NotNegotiated`.

The function proceeds calling the chain function installed on `self` (see
`gst_pad_set_chain_function`) and the return value of that function is
returned to the caller. `FlowReturn::NotSupported` is returned if `self` has no
chain function.

In all cases, success or failure, the caller loses its reference to `buffer`
after calling this function.

If `self` was not negotiated properly with a CAPS event, this function
returns `FlowReturn::NotNegotiated`.

The function proceeds calling the chainlist function installed on `self` (see
`gst_pad_set_chain_list_function`) and the return value of that function is
returned to the caller. `FlowReturn::NotSupported` is returned if `self` has no
chainlist function.

In all cases, success or failure, the caller loses its reference to `list`
after calling this function.

MT safe.

<!-- trait PadExt::fn create_stream_id -->
Creates a stream-id for the source `Pad` `self` by combining the
upstream information with the optional `stream_id` of the stream
of `self`. `self` must have a parent `Element` and which must have zero
or one sinkpad. `stream_id` can only be `None` if the parent element
of `self` has only a single source pad.

This function generates an unique stream-id by getting the upstream
stream-start event stream ID and appending `stream_id` to it. If the
element has no sinkpad it will generate an upstream stream-id by
doing an URI query on the element and in the worst case just uses
a random number. Source elements that don't implement the URI
handler interface should ideally generate a unique, deterministic
stream-id manually instead.

Since stream IDs are sorted alphabetically, any numbers in the
stream ID should be printed with a fixed number of characters,
preceded by 0's, such as by using the format \%03u instead of \%u.
## `parent`
Parent `Element` of `self`
## `stream_id`
The stream-id

# Returns

A stream-id for `self`. `g_free` after usage.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn create_stream_id_printf -->
Creates a stream-id for the source `Pad` `self` by combining the
upstream information with the optional `stream_id` of the stream
of `self`. `self` must have a parent `Element` and which must have zero
or one sinkpad. `stream_id` can only be `None` if the parent element
of `self` has only a single source pad.

This function generates an unique stream-id by getting the upstream
stream-start event stream ID and appending `stream_id` to it. If the
element has no sinkpad it will generate an upstream stream-id by
doing an URI query on the element and in the worst case just uses
a random number. Source elements that don't implement the URI
handler interface should ideally generate a unique, deterministic
stream-id manually instead.
## `parent`
Parent `Element` of `self`
## `stream_id`
The stream-id

# Returns

A stream-id for `self`. `g_free` after usage.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn create_stream_id_printf_valist -->
Creates a stream-id for the source `Pad` `self` by combining the
upstream information with the optional `stream_id` of the stream
of `self`. `self` must have a parent `Element` and which must have zero
or one sinkpad. `stream_id` can only be `None` if the parent element
of `self` has only a single source pad.

This function generates an unique stream-id by getting the upstream
stream-start event stream ID and appending `stream_id` to it. If the
element has no sinkpad it will generate an upstream stream-id by
doing an URI query on the element and in the worst case just uses
a random number. Source elements that don't implement the URI
handler interface should ideally generate a unique, deterministic
stream-id manually instead.

## `event`
the `Event` to handle.

# Returns

`true` if the event was sent successfully.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn forward -->
Calls `forward` for all internally linked pads of `self`. This function deals with
dynamically changing internal pads and will make sure that the `forward`
function is only called once for each pad.

When `forward` returns `true`, no further pads will be processed.
## `forward`
a `GstPadForwardFunction`
## `user_data`
user data passed to `forward`

# Returns

`true` if one of the dispatcher functions returned `true`.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_allowed_caps -->
Gets the capabilities of the allowed media types that can flow through
`self` and its peer.

The allowed capabilities is calculated as the intersection of the results of
calling `PadExt::query_caps` on `self` and its peer. The caller owns a reference
on the resulting caps.

# Returns

the allowed `Caps` of the
 pad link. Unref the caps when you no longer need it. This
 function returns `None` when `self` has no peer.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_current_caps -->

`EventType::Caps` event.

# Returns

the current caps of the pad with
incremented ref-count or `None` when pad has no caps. Unref after usage.

pad.

# Returns

the offset.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_pad_template -->
Gets the template for `self`.

# Returns

the `PadTemplate` from which
 this pad was instantiated, or `None` if this pad has no
 template. Unref after usage.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_pad_template_caps -->
Gets the capabilities for `self`'s template.

# Returns

the `Caps` of this pad template.
Unref after usage.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_parent_element -->
Gets the parent of `self`, cast to a `Element`. If a `self` has no parent or
its parent is not an element, return `None`.

# Returns

the parent of the pad. The
caller has a reference on the parent, so unref when you're finished
with it.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_peer -->
Gets the peer of `self`. This function refs the peer pad so
you need to unref it after use.

# Returns

the peer `Pad`. Unref after usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_range -->
When `self` is flushing this function returns `FlowReturn::Flushing`
immediately and `buffer` is `None`.

Calls the getrange function of `self`, see `GstPadGetRangeFunction` for a
description of a getrange function. If `self` has no getrange function
installed (see `gst_pad_set_getrange_function`) this function returns
`FlowReturn::NotSupported`.

If `buffer` points to a variable holding `None`, a valid new `Buffer` will be
placed in `buffer` when this function returns `FlowReturn::Ok`. The new buffer
must be freed with `gst_buffer_unref` after usage.

When `buffer` points to a variable that points to a valid `Buffer`, the
buffer will be filled with the result data when this function returns
`FlowReturn::Ok`. If the provided buffer is larger than `size`, only
`size` bytes will be filled in the result buffer and its size will be updated
accordingly.

Note that less than `size` bytes can be returned in `buffer` when, for example,
an EOS condition is near or when `buffer` is not large enough to hold `size`
bytes. The caller should check the result buffer size to get the result size.

When this function returns any other result value than `FlowReturn::Ok`, `buffer`
will be unchanged.

This is a lowlevel function. Usually `Pad::pull_range` is used.
## `offset`
The start offset of the buffer
## `size`
The length of the buffer
## `buffer`
a pointer to hold the `Buffer`,
 returns `FlowReturn::Error` if `None`.

# Returns

a `FlowReturn` from the pad.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_sticky_event -->
Returns a new reference of the sticky event of type `event_type`
from the event.
## `event_type`
the `EventType` that should be retrieved.
## `idx`
the index of the event

# Returns

a `Event` of type
`event_type` or `None` when no event of `event_type` was on
`self`. Unref after usage.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_stream -->
Returns the current `Stream` for the `self`, or `None` if none has been
set yet, i.e. the pad has not received a stream-start event yet.

This is a convenience wrapper around `PadExt::get_sticky_event` and
`Event::parse_stream`.

Feature: `v1_10`


# Returns

the current `Stream` for `self`, or `None`.
 unref the returned stream when no longer needed.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn get_stream_id -->
Returns the current stream-id for the `self`, or `None` if none has been
set yet, i.e. the pad has not received a stream-start event yet.

This is a convenience wrapper around `PadExt::get_sticky_event` and
`Event::parse_stream_start`.

The returned stream-id string should be treated as an opaque string, its
contents should not be interpreted.

Checks if the pad is blocked or not. This function returns the
last requested state of the pad. It is not certain that the pad
is actually blocking at this point (see `PadExt::is_blocking`).

# Returns

`true` if the pad is blocked.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn is_blocking -->
Checks if the pad is blocking or not. This is a guaranteed state
of whether the pad is actually blocking on a `Buffer` or a `Event`.

`true` if the pad is blocking.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn is_linked -->
Checks if a `self` is linked to another pad or not.

# Returns

`true` if the pad is linked, `false` otherwise.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn iterate_internal_links -->
Gets an iterator for the pads to which the given pad is linked to inside
of the parent element.

Each `Pad` element yielded by the iterator will have its refcount increased,
so unref after use.

Free-function: gst_iterator_free

# Returns

a new `Iterator` of `Pad`
 or `None` when the pad does not have an iterator function
 configured. Use `Iterator::free` after usage.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn iterate_internal_links_default -->
Iterate the list of pads to which the given pad is linked to inside of
the parent element.
This is the default handler, and thus returns an iterator of all of the
pads inside the parent element with opposite direction.

The caller must free this iterator after use with `Iterator::free`.
## `parent`
the parent of `self` or `None`

the sink `Pad` to link.

# Returns

A result code indicating if the connection worked or
 what went wrong.

MT Safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn link_full -->
Links the source pad and the sink pad.

This variant of `PadExt::link` provides a more granular control on the
checks being done when linking. While providing some considerable speedups
the caller of this method must be aware that wrong usage of those flags
can cause severe issues. Refer to the documentation of `PadLinkCheck`
for more information.

MT Safe.
## `sinkpad`
the sink `Pad` to link.
## `flags`
the checks to validate when linking

This is a convenience function to save having to create and add intermediate
`GhostPad`'s as required for linking across `Bin` boundaries.

If `self` or `sink` pads don't have parent elements or do not share a common
ancestor, the link will fail.

Feature: `v1_10`

## `sink`
a `Pad`

# Returns

whether the link succeeded.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn link_maybe_ghosting_full -->
Links `self` to `sink`, creating any `GhostPad`'s in between as necessary.

This is a convenience function to save having to create and add intermediate
`GhostPad`'s as required for linking across `Bin` boundaries.

If `self` or `sink` pads don't have parent elements or do not share a common
ancestor, the link will fail.

Calling `PadExt::link_maybe_ghosting_full` with
`flags` == `PadLinkCheck::Default` is the recommended way of linking
pads with safety checks applied.

Feature: `v1_10`

## `sink`
a `Pad`
## `flags`
some `PadLinkCheck` flags

# Returns

whether the link succeeded.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn mark_reconfigure -->

`PadExt::check_reconfigure` will return `true` after this call.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn needs_reconfigure -->
Check the `PadFlags::NeedReconfigure` flag on `self` and return `true`
if the flag was set.

# Returns

`true` is the GST_PAD_FLAG_NEED_RECONFIGURE flag is set on `self`.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn pause_task -->
Pause the task of `self`. This function will also wait until the
function executed by the task is finished if this function is not
called from the task function.

# Returns

a `true` if the task could be paused or `false` when the pad
has no task.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn peer_query -->
Performs `Pad::query` on the peer of `self`.

The caller is responsible for both the allocation and deallocation of
the query structure.
## `query`
the `Query` to perform.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed. This function returns `false`
if `self` has no peer.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn peer_query_accept_caps -->
Check if the peer of `self` accepts `caps`. If `self` has no peer, this function
returns `true`.
## `caps`

# Returns

`true` if the peer of `self` can accept the caps or `self` has no peer.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn peer_query_caps -->
Gets the capabilities of the peer connected to this pad. Similar to
`PadExt::query_caps`.

When called on srcpads `filter` contains the caps that
upstream could produce in the order preferred by upstream. When
called on sinkpads `filter` contains the caps accepted by
downstream in the preferred order. `filter` might be `None` but
if it is not `None` the returned caps will be a subset of `filter`.
## `filter`
a `Caps` filter, or `None`.

# Returns

the caps of the peer pad with incremented
ref-count. When there is no peer pad, this function returns `filter` or,
when `filter` is `None`, ANY caps.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn peer_query_convert -->
Queries the peer pad of a given sink pad to convert `src_val` in `src_format`
to `dest_format`.
## `src_format`

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn proxy_query_accept_caps -->
Checks if all internally linked pads of `self` accepts the caps in `query` and
returns the intersection of the results.

This function is useful as a default accept caps query function for an element
that can handle any stream format, but requires caps that are acceptable for
all opposite pads.
## `query`
an ACCEPT_CAPS `Query`.

# Returns

`true` if `query` could be executed
<!-- trait PadExt::fn proxy_query_caps -->
Calls `PadExt::query_caps` for all internally linked pads of `self` and returns
the intersection of the results.

This function is useful as a default caps query function for an element
that can handle any stream format, but requires all its pads to have
the same caps. Two such elements are tee and adder.
## `query`
a CAPS `Query`.

# Returns

`true` if `query` could be executed
<!-- trait PadExt::fn pull_range -->
Pulls a `buffer` from the peer pad or fills up a provided buffer.

This function will first trigger the pad block signal if it was
installed.

When `self` is not linked `FlowReturn::NotLinked` is returned else this
function returns the result of `Pad::get_range` on the peer pad.
See `Pad::get_range` for a list of return values and for the
semantics of the arguments of this function.

If `buffer` points to a variable holding `None`, a valid new `Buffer` will be
placed in `buffer` when this function returns `FlowReturn::Ok`. The new buffer
must be freed with `gst_buffer_unref` after usage. When this function
returns any other result value, `buffer` will still point to `None`.

When `buffer` points to a variable that points to a valid `Buffer`, the
buffer will be filled with the result data when this function returns
`FlowReturn::Ok`. When this function returns any other result value,
`buffer` will be unchanged. If the provided buffer is larger than `size`, only
`size` bytes will be filled in the result buffer and its size will be updated
accordingly.

Note that less than `size` bytes can be returned in `buffer` when, for example,
an EOS condition is near or when `buffer` is not large enough to hold `size`
bytes. The caller should check the result buffer size to get the result size.
## `offset`
The start offset of the buffer
## `size`
The length of the buffer
## `buffer`
a pointer to hold the `Buffer`, returns
 GST_FLOW_ERROR if `None`.

# Returns

a `FlowReturn` from the peer pad.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn push -->
Pushes a buffer to the peer of `self`.

This function will call installed block probes before triggering any
installed data probes.

The function proceeds calling `Pad::chain` on the peer pad and returns
the value from that function. If `self` has no peer, `FlowReturn::NotLinked` will
be returned.

In all cases, success or failure, the caller loses its reference to `buffer`
after calling this function.
## `buffer`
the `Buffer` to push returns GST_FLOW_ERROR
 if not.

# Returns

a `FlowReturn` from the peer pad.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn push_event -->
Sends the event to the peer of the given pad. This function is
mainly used by elements to send events to their peer
elements.

This function takes ownership of the provided event so you should
`gst_event_ref` it if you want to reuse the event after this call.
## `event`
the `Event` to send to the pad.

# Returns

`true` if the event was handled.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn push_list -->
Pushes a buffer list to the peer of `self`.

This function will call installed block probes before triggering any
installed data probes.

The function proceeds calling the chain function on the peer pad and returns
the value from that function. If `self` has no peer, `FlowReturn::NotLinked` will
be returned. If the peer pad does not have any installed chainlist function
every group buffer of the list will be merged into a normal `Buffer` and
chained via `Pad::chain`.

In all cases, success or failure, the caller loses its reference to `list`
after calling this function.
## `list`
the `BufferList` to push returns GST_FLOW_ERROR
 if not.

# Returns

a `FlowReturn` from the peer pad.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn query -->
Dispatches a query to a pad. The query should have been allocated by the
caller via one of the type-specific allocation functions. The element that
the pad belongs to is responsible for filling the query with an appropriate
response, which should then be parsed with a type-specific query parsing
function.

Again, the caller is responsible for both the allocation and deallocation of
the query structure.

Please also note that some queries might need a running pipeline to work.
## `query`
the `Query` to perform.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn query_accept_caps -->
Check if the given pad accepts the caps.
## `caps`
a `Caps` to check on the pad

# Returns

`true` if the pad can accept the caps.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn query_caps -->
Gets the capabilities this pad can produce or consume.
Note that this method doesn't necessarily return the caps set by sending a
`Event::new_caps` - use `PadExt::get_current_caps` for that instead.
gst_pad_query_caps returns all possible caps a pad can operate with, using
the pad's CAPS query function, If the query fails, this function will return
`filter`, if not `None`, otherwise ANY.

When called on sinkpads `filter` contains the caps that
upstream could produce in the order preferred by upstream. When
called on srcpads `filter` contains the caps accepted by
downstream in the preferred order. `filter` might be `None` but
if it is not `None` the returned caps will be a subset of `filter`.

Note that this function does not return writable `Caps`, use
`gst_caps_make_writable` before modifying the caps.
## `filter`
suggested `Caps`, or `None`

# Returns

the caps of the pad with incremented ref-count.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn query_convert -->
Queries a pad to convert `src_val` in `src_format` to `dest_format`.

## `src_val`
a value to convert.
## `dest_format`
the `Format` to convert to.
## `dest_val`
a pointer to the result.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn query_default -->
Invokes the default query handler for the given pad.
The query is sent to all pads internally linked to `self`. Note that
if there are many possible sink pads that are internally linked to
`self`, only one will be sent the query.
Multi-sinkpad elements should implement custom query handlers.
## `parent`
the parent of `self` or `None`
## `query`
the `Query` to handle.

# Returns

`true` if the query was performed successfully.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn query_duration -->
Queries a pad for the total stream duration.
## `format`
the `Format` requested
## `duration`
a location in which to store the total
 duration, or `None`.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn query_position -->
Queries a pad for the stream position.
## `format`
the `Format` requested
## `cur`
A location in which to store the current position, or `None`.

# Returns

`true` if the query could be performed.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn remove_probe -->
Remove the probe with `id` from `self`.

MT safe.
## `id`
the probe id to remove
<!-- trait PadExt::fn send_event -->
Sends the event to the pad. This function can be used
by applications to send events in the pipeline.

If `self` is a source pad, `event` should be an upstream event. If `self` is a
sink pad, `event` should be a downstream event. For example, you would not
send a `EventType::Eos` on a src pad; EOS events only propagate downstream.
Furthermore, some downstream events have to be serialized with data flow,
like EOS, while some can travel out-of-band, like `EventType::FlushStart`. If
the event needs to be serialized with data flow, this function will take the
pad's stream lock while calling its event function.

To find out whether an event type is upstream, downstream, or downstream and
serialized, see `EventTypeFlags`, `EventType::get_flags`,
`GST_EVENT_IS_UPSTREAM`, `GST_EVENT_IS_DOWNSTREAM`, and
`GST_EVENT_IS_SERIALIZED`. Note that in practice that an application or
plugin doesn't need to bother itself with this information; the core handles
all necessary locks and checks.

This function takes ownership of the provided event so you should
`gst_event_ref` it if you want to reuse the event after this call.
## `event`
the `Event` to send to the pad.

# Returns

`true` if the event was handled.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn set_activate_function_full -->

If `active`, makes sure the pad is active. If it is already active, either in
push or pull mode, just return. Otherwise dispatches to the pad's activate
function to perform the actual activation.

If not `active`, calls `PadExt::activate_mode` with the pad's current mode
and a `false` argument.
## `active`
whether or not the pad should be active.

# Returns

`true` if the operation was successful.

 should be called for every event.
## `user_data`
the optional user data.
<!-- trait PadExt::fn stop_task -->
Stop the task of `self`. This function will also make sure that the
function executed by the task will effectively stop if not called
from the GstTaskFunction.

This function will deadlock if called from the GstTaskFunction of
the task. Use `Task::pause` instead.

Regardless of whether the pad has a task, the stream lock is acquired and

parent element goes from READY to PAUSED, the GstPadMode defines if the
pad operates in push or pull mode.
<!-- enum PadMode::variant None -->
Pad will not handle dataflow
<!-- enum PadMode::variant Push -->
Pad handles dataflow in downstream push mode
<!-- enum PadMode::variant Pull -->
Pad handles dataflow in upstream pull mode

<!-- enum PadProbeReturn::variant Drop -->
drop data in data probes. For push mode this means that
 the data item is not sent downstream. For pull mode, it means that
 the data item is not passed upstream. In both cases, no other probes
 are called for this item and `FlowReturn::Ok` or `true` is returned to the
 caller.
<!-- enum PadProbeReturn::variant Ok -->
normal probe return value. This leaves the probe in
 place, and defers decisions about dropping or passing data to other
 probes, if any. If there are no other probes, the default behaviour
 for the probe type applies ('block' for blocking probes,
 and 'pass' for non-blocking probes).
<!-- enum PadProbeReturn::variant Remove -->
remove this probe.
<!-- enum PadProbeReturn::variant Pass -->
pass the data item in the block probe and block on the
 next item.
<!-- enum PadProbeReturn::variant Handled -->
Data has been handled in the probe and will not be
 forwarded further. For events and buffers this is the same behaviour as
 `PadProbeReturn::Drop` (except that in this case you need to unref the buffer
 or event yourself). For queries it will also return `true` to the caller.
 The probe can also modify the `FlowReturn` value by using the
 `GST_PAD_PROBE_INFO_FLOW_RETURN`() accessor.
 Note that the resulting query must contain valid entries.
 Since: 1.6
<!-- struct PadTemplate -->
Padtemplates describe the possible media types a pad or an elementfactory can
handle. This allows for both inspection of handled types before loading the
element plugin as well as identifying pads on elements that are not yet
created (request or sometimes pads).

Pad and PadTemplates have `Caps` attached to it to describe the media type
they are capable of dealing with. `PadTemplate::get_caps` or
GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_CAPS() are used to get the caps of a padtemplate. It's not
possible to modify the caps of a padtemplate after creation.

PadTemplates have a `PadPresence` property which identifies the lifetime
of the pad and that can be retrieved with GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_PRESENCE(). Also
the direction of the pad can be retrieved from the `PadTemplate` with
GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_DIRECTION().

The GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_NAME_TEMPLATE () is important for GST_PAD_REQUEST pads
because it has to be used as the name in the `ElementExt::get_request_pad`
call to instantiate a pad from this template.

Padtemplates can be created with `PadTemplate::new` or with
gst_static_pad_template_get (), which creates a `PadTemplate` from a
`StaticPadTemplate` that can be filled with the
convenient GST_STATIC_PAD_TEMPLATE() macro.

A padtemplate can be used to create a pad (see `Pad::new_from_template`
or gst_pad_new_from_static_template ()) or to add to an element class
(see gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template ()).

The following code example shows the code to create a pad from a padtemplate.

```C
  GstStaticPadTemplate my_template =
  GST_STATIC_PAD_TEMPLATE (
    "sink",          // the name of the pad
    GST_PAD_SINK,    // the direction of the pad
    GST_PAD_ALWAYS,  // when this pad will be present
    GST_STATIC_CAPS (        // the capabilities of the padtemplate
      "audio/x-raw, "
        "channels = (int) [ 1, 6 ]"
    )
  );
  void
  my_method (void)
  {
    GstPad *pad;
    pad = gst_pad_new_from_static_template (&amp;my_template, "sink");
    ...
  }
```

The following example shows you how to add the padtemplate to an
element class, this is usually done in the class_init of the class:

```C
  static void
  my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
  {
    GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);

    gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &amp;my_template);
  }
```

<!-- struct Pipeline -->
A `Pipeline` is a special `Bin` used as the toplevel container for
the filter graph. The `Pipeline` will manage the selection and
distribution of a global `Clock` as well as provide a `Bus` to the
application.

`Pipeline::new` is used to create a pipeline. when you are done with
the pipeline, use `GstObjectExt::unref` to free its resources including all
added `Element` objects (if not otherwise referenced).

Elements are added and removed from the pipeline using the `Bin`
methods like `BinExt::add` and `BinExt::remove` (see `Bin`).

Before changing the state of the `Pipeline` (see `Element`) a `Bus`
can be retrieved with `Pipeline::get_bus`. This bus can then be
used to receive `Message` from the elements in the pipeline.

By default, a `Pipeline` will automatically flush the pending `Bus`
messages when going to the NULL state to ensure that no circular
references exist when no messages are read from the `Bus`. This
behaviour can be changed with `PipelineExt::set_auto_flush_bus`.

When the `Pipeline` performs the PAUSED to PLAYING state change it will
select a clock for the elements. The clock selection algorithm will by
default select a clock provided by an element that is most upstream
(closest to the source). For live pipelines (ones that return
`StateChangeReturn::NoPreroll` from the `ElementExt::set_state` call) this
will select the clock provided by the live source. For normal pipelines
this will select a clock provided by the sinks (most likely the audio
sink). If no element provides a clock, a default `SystemClock` is used.

The clock selection can be controlled with the `PipelineExt::use_clock`
method, which will enforce a given clock on the pipeline. With
`PipelineExt::auto_clock` the default clock selection algorithm can be
restored.

A `Pipeline` maintains a running time for the elements. The running
time is defined as the difference between the current clock time and
the base time. When the pipeline goes to READY or a flushing seek is
performed on it, the running time is reset to 0. When the pipeline is
set from PLAYING to PAUSED, the current clock time is sampled and used to
configure the base time for the elements when the pipeline is set
to PLAYING again. The effect is that the running time (as the difference
between the clock time and the base time) will count how much time was spent
in the PLAYING state. This default behaviour can be changed with the
`ElementExt::set_start_time` method.

<!-- trait PipelineExt -->
Trait containing all `Pipeline` methods.

# Implementors

[`Pipeline`](struct.Pipeline.html)
<!-- impl Pipeline::fn new -->
Create a new pipeline with the given name.
## `name`
name of new pipeline

# Returns

newly created GstPipeline

MT safe.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn auto_clock -->
Let `self` select a clock automatically. This is the default
behaviour.

Use this function if you previous forced a fixed clock with
`PipelineExt::use_clock` and want to restore the default
pipeline clock selection algorithm.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn get_auto_flush_bus -->
Check if `self` will automatically flush messages when going to
the NULL state.

# Returns

whether the pipeline will automatically flush its bus when
going from READY to NULL state or not.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn get_bus -->
Gets the `Bus` of `self`. The bus allows applications to receive
`Message` packets.

# Returns

a `Bus`, unref after usage.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn get_clock -->
Gets the current clock used by `self`. Users of object
oriented languages should use `PipelineExt::get_pipeline_clock`
to avoid confusion with `ElementExt::get_clock` which has a different behavior.

Unlike `ElementExt::get_clock`, this function will always return a
clock, even if the pipeline is not in the PLAYING state.

# Returns

a `Clock`, unref after usage.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn get_delay -->
Get the configured delay (see `PipelineExt::set_delay`).

# Returns

The configured delay.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn get_latency -->
Gets the latency that should be configured on the pipeline. See
`PipelineExt::set_latency`.

# Returns

Latency to configure on the pipeline or GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn get_pipeline_clock -->
Gets the current clock used by `self`.

Unlike `ElementExt::get_clock`, this function will always return a
clock, even if the pipeline is not in the PLAYING state.

# Returns

a `Clock`, unref after usage.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn set_auto_flush_bus -->
Usually, when a pipeline goes from READY to NULL state, it automatically
flushes all pending messages on the bus, which is done for refcounting
purposes, to break circular references.

This means that applications that update state using (async) bus messages
(e.g. do certain things when a pipeline goes from PAUSED to READY) might
not get to see messages when the pipeline is shut down, because they might
be flushed before they can be dispatched in the main thread. This behaviour
can be disabled using this function.

It is important that all messages on the bus are handled when the
automatic flushing is disabled else memory leaks will be introduced.

MT safe.
## `auto_flush`
whether or not to automatically flush the bus when
the pipeline goes from READY to NULL state
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn set_clock -->
Set the clock for `self`. The clock will be distributed
to all the elements managed by the pipeline.
## `clock`
the clock to set

# Returns

`true` if the clock could be set on the pipeline. `false` if
 some element did not accept the clock.

MT safe.
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn set_delay -->
Set the expected delay needed for all elements to perform the
PAUSED to PLAYING state change. `delay` will be added to the
base time of the elements so that they wait an additional `delay`
amount of time before starting to process buffers and cannot be
`GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE`.

This option is used for tuning purposes and should normally not be
used.

MT safe.
## `delay`
the delay
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn set_latency -->
Sets the latency that should be configured on the pipeline. Setting
GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE will restore the default behaviour of using the minimum
latency from the LATENCY query. Setting this is usually not required and
the pipeline will figure out an appropriate latency automatically.

Setting a too low latency, especially lower than the minimum latency from
the LATENCY query, will most likely cause the pipeline to fail.
## `latency`
latency to configure
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn use_clock -->
Force `self` to use the given `clock`. The pipeline will
always use the given clock even if new clock providers are added
to this pipeline.

If `clock` is `None` all clocking will be disabled which will make
the pipeline run as fast as possible.

MT safe.
## `clock`
the clock to use
<!-- trait PipelineExt::fn get_property_auto-flush-bus -->
Whether or not to automatically flush all messages on the
pipeline's bus when going from READY to NULL state. Please see
`PipelineExt::set_auto_flush_bus` for more information on this option.

<!-- struct Plugin -->
GStreamer is extensible, so `Element` instances can be loaded at runtime.
A plugin system can provide one or more of the basic
`<application>`GStreamer`</application>` `PluginFeature` subclasses.

A plugin should export a symbol `<symbol>`gst_plugin_desc`</symbol>` that is a
struct of type `PluginDesc`.
the plugin loader will check the version of the core library the plugin was
linked against and will create a new `Plugin`. It will then call the
`GstPluginInitFunc` function that was provided in the
`<symbol>`gst_plugin_desc`</symbol>`.

Once you have a handle to a `Plugin` (e.g. from the `Registry`), you
can add any object that subclasses `PluginFeature`.

Usually plugins are always automatically loaded so you don't need to call
`Plugin::load` explicitly to bring it into memory. There are options to
statically link plugins to an app or even use GStreamer without a plugin
repository in which case `Plugin::load` can be needed to bring the plugin
into memory.

For normal GStreamer plugin releases this will usually just be a date in
the form of "YYYY-MM-DD", while pre-releases and builds from git may contain
a time component after the date as well, in which case the string will be
formatted like "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ" (e.g. "2012-04-30T09:30Z").

<!-- struct Preset -->
This interface offers methods to query and manipulate parameter preset sets.
A preset is a bunch of property settings, together with meta data and a name.
The name of a preset serves as key for subsequent method calls to manipulate
single presets.
All instances of one type will share the list of presets. The list is created
on demand, if presets are not used, the list is not created.

The interface comes with a default implementation that serves most plugins.
Wrapper plugins will override most methods to implement support for the
native preset format of those wrapped plugins.
One method that is useful to be overridden is `Preset::get_property_names`.
With that one can control which properties are saved and in which order.
When implementing support for read-only presets, one should set the vmethods
for `Preset::save_preset` and `Preset::delete_preset` to `None`.
Applications can use `Preset::is_editable` to check for that.

The default implementation supports presets located in a system directory,
application specific directory and in the users home directory. When getting
a list of presets individual presets are read and overlaid in 1) system,
2) application and 3) user order. Whenever an earlier entry is newer, the
later entries will be updated. Since 1.8 you can also provide extra paths
where to find presets through the GST_PRESET_PATH environment variable.
Presets found in those paths will be concidered as "app presets".

<!-- enum ProgressType -->

<!-- struct Promise -->
The `Promise` object implements the container for values that may
be available later. i.e. a Future or a Promise in
<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises`</ulink>`
As with all Future/Promise-like functionality, there is the concept of the
producer of the value and the consumer of the value.

A `Promise` is created with `Promise::new` by the consumer and passed
to the producer to avoid thread safety issues with the change callback.
A `Promise` can be replied to with a value (or an error) by the producer
with `Promise::reply`. `Promise::interrupt` is for the consumer to
indicate to the producer that the value is not needed anymore and producing
that value can stop. The `PromiseResult::Expired` state set by a call
to `Promise::expire` indicates to the consumer that a value will never
be produced and is intended to be called by a third party that implements
some notion of message handling such as `Bus`.
A callback can also be installed at `Promise` creation for
result changes with `Promise::new_with_change_func`.
The change callback can be used to chain `GstPromises`'s together as in the
following example.

```C
const GstStructure *reply;
GstPromise *p;
if (gst_promise_wait (promise) != GST_PROMISE_RESULT_REPLIED)
  return; // interrupted or expired value
reply = gst_promise_get_reply (promise);
if (error in reply)
  return; // propagate error
p = gst_promise_new_with_change_func (another_promise_change_func, user_data, notify);
pass p to promise-using API
```

Each `Promise` starts out with a `PromiseResult` of
`PromiseResult::Pending` and only ever transitions once
into one of the other `PromiseResult`'s.

In order to support multi-threaded code, `Promise::reply`,
`Promise::interrupt` and `Promise::expire` may all be from
different threads with some restrictions and the final result of the promise
is whichever call is made first. There are two restrictions on ordering:

1. That `Promise::reply` and `Promise::interrupt` cannot be called
after `Promise::expire`
2. That `Promise::reply` and `Promise::interrupt`
cannot be called twice.

The change function set with `Promise::new_with_change_func` is
called directly from either the `Promise::reply`,
`Promise::interrupt` or `Promise::expire` and can be called
from an arbitrary thread. `Promise` using APIs can restrict this to
a single thread or a subset of threads but that is entirely up to the API
that uses `Promise`.

<!-- struct Query -->
Queries can be performed on pads (`Pad::query`) and elements
(`Element::query`). Please note that some queries might need a running
pipeline to work.

Queries can be created using the gst_query_new_*() functions.
Query values can be set using gst_query_set_*(), and parsed using
gst_query_parse_*() helpers.

The following example shows how to query the duration of a pipeline:

```C
  GstQuery *query;
  gboolean res;
  query = gst_query_new_duration (GST_FORMAT_TIME);
  res = gst_element_query (pipeline, query);
  if (res) {
    gint64 duration;
    gst_query_parse_duration (query, NULL, &amp;duration);
    g_print ("duration = %"GST_TIME_FORMAT, GST_TIME_ARGS (duration));
  } else {

<!-- impl Query::fn new_caps -->
Constructs a new query object for querying the caps.

The CAPS query should return the allowable caps for a pad in the context
of the element's state, its link to other elements, and the devices or files
it has opened. These caps must be a subset of the pad template caps. In the
NULL state with no links, the CAPS query should ideally return the same caps
as the pad template. In rare circumstances, an object property can affect
the caps returned by the CAPS query, but this is discouraged.

For most filters, the caps returned by CAPS query is directly affected by the
allowed caps on other pads. For demuxers and decoders, the caps returned by
the srcpad's getcaps function is directly related to the stream data. Again,
the CAPS query should return the most specific caps it reasonably can, since this
helps with autoplugging.

The `filter` is used to restrict the result caps, only the caps matching
`filter` should be returned from the CAPS query. Specifying a filter might
greatly reduce the amount of processing an element needs to do.

<!-- struct Registry -->
One registry holds the metadata of a set of plugins.

<emphasis role="bold">Design:`</emphasis>`

The `Registry` object is a list of plugins and some functions for dealing
with them. Each `Plugin` is matched 1-1 with a file on disk, and may or may
not be loaded at a given time.

The primary source, at all times, of plugin information is each plugin file
itself. Thus, if an application wants information about a particular plugin,
or wants to search for a feature that satisfies given criteria, the primary
means of doing so is to load every plugin and look at the resulting
information that is gathered in the default registry. Clearly, this is a time
consuming process, so we cache information in the registry file. The format
and location of the cache file is internal to gstreamer.

On startup, plugins are searched for in the plugin search path. The following
locations are checked in this order:

* location from --gst-plugin-path commandline option.
* the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
* the GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH environment variable.
* default locations (if GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH is not set).
 Those default locations are:
 `$XDG_DATA_HOME/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/plugins/`
 and `$prefix/libs/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/`.
 [$XDG_DATA_HOME](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) defaults to
 `$HOME/.local/share`.

The registry cache file is loaded from
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/registry-$ARCH.bin`
(where $XDG_CACHE_HOME defaults to `$HOME/.cache`) or the file listed in the `GST_REGISTRY`
env var. One reason to change the registry location is for testing.

For each plugin that is found in the plugin search path, there could be 3
possibilities for cached information:

 * the cache may not contain information about a given file.
 * the cache may have stale information.
 * the cache may have current information.

In the first two cases, the plugin is loaded and the cache updated. In
addition to these cases, the cache may have entries for plugins that are not
relevant to the current process. These are marked as not available to the
current process. If the cache is updated for whatever reason, it is marked
dirty.

A dirty cache is written out at the end of initialization. Each entry is
checked to make sure the information is minimally valid. If not, the entry is
simply dropped.

## Implementation notes:

The "cache" and "registry" are different concepts and can represent
different sets of plugins. For various reasons, at init time, the cache is
stored in the default registry, and plugins not relevant to the current
process are marked with the `PluginFlags::Cached` bit. These plugins are
removed at the end of initialization.

<!-- struct Segment -->
This helper structure holds the relevant values for tracking the region of
interest in a media file, called a segment.

The structure can be used for two purposes:

 * performing seeks (handling seek events)
 * tracking playback regions (handling newsegment events)

The segment is usually configured by the application with a seek event which
is propagated upstream and eventually handled by an element that performs the seek.

The configured segment is then propagated back downstream with a newsegment event.
This information is then used to clip media to the segment boundaries.

A segment structure is initialized with `Segment::init`, which takes a `Format`
that will be used as the format of the segment values. The segment will be configured
with a start value of 0 and a stop/duration of -1, which is undefined. The default
rate and applied_rate is 1.0.

The public duration field contains the duration of the segment. When using
the segment for seeking, the start and time members should normally be left
to their default 0 value. The stop position is left to -1 unless explicitly
configured to a different value after a seek event.

The current position in the segment should be set by changing the position
member in the structure.

For elements that perform seeks, the current segment should be updated with the
`Segment::do_seek` and the values from the seek event. This method will update
all the segment fields. The position field will contain the new playback position.
If the start_type was different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE, playback continues from
the position position, possibly with updated flags or rate.

For elements that want to use `Segment` to track the playback region,
update the segment fields with the information from the newsegment event.
The `Segment::clip` method can be used to check and clip
the media data to the segment boundaries.

For elements that want to synchronize to the pipeline clock, `Segment::to_running_time`
can be used to convert a timestamp to a value that can be used to synchronize
to the clock. This function takes into account the base as well as
any rate or applied_rate conversions.

For elements that need to perform operations on media data in stream_time,
`Segment::to_stream_time` can be used to convert a timestamp and the segment
info to stream time (which is always between 0 and the duration of the stream).
<!-- impl Segment::fn new -->
Allocate a new `Segment` structure and initialize it using
`Segment::init`.

Free-function: gst_segment_free

# Returns

a new `Segment`, free with `Segment::free`.
<!-- impl Segment::fn clip -->
Clip the given `start` and `stop` values to the segment boundaries given
in `self`. `start` and `stop` are compared and clipped to `self`
start and stop values.

If the function returns `false`, `start` and `stop` are known to fall
outside of `self` and `clip_start` and `clip_stop` are not updated.

When the function returns `true`, `clip_start` and `clip_stop` will be
updated. If `clip_start` or `clip_stop` are different from `start` or `stop`
respectively, the region fell partially in the segment.

Note that when `stop` is -1, `clip_stop` will be set to the end of the
segment. Depending on the use case, this may or may not be what you want.
## `format`
the format of the segment.
## `start`
the start position in the segment
## `stop`
the stop position in the segment
## `clip_start`
the clipped start position in the segment
## `clip_stop`

# Returns

`true` if the given `start` and `stop` times fall partially or
 completely in `self`, `false` if the values are completely outside
 of the segment.
<!-- impl Segment::fn copy -->
Create a copy of given `self`.

Free-function: gst_segment_free

# Returns

a new `Segment`, free with `Segment::free`.
<!-- impl Segment::fn copy_into -->
Copy the contents of `self` into `dest`.
## `dest`
a `Segment`
<!-- impl Segment::fn do_seek -->
Update the segment structure with the field values of a seek event (see
`Event::new_seek`).

After calling this method, the segment field position and time will
contain the requested new position in the segment. The new requested
position in the segment depends on `rate` and `start_type` and `stop_type`.

For positive `rate`, the new position in the segment is the new `self`
start field when it was updated with a `start_type` different from
`SeekType::None`. If no update was performed on `self` start position
(`SeekType::None`), `start` is ignored and `self` position is
unmodified.

For negative `rate`, the new position in the segment is the new `self`
stop field when it was updated with a `stop_type` different from
`SeekType::None`. If no stop was previously configured in the segment, the
duration of the segment will be used to update the stop position.
If no update was performed on `self` stop position (`SeekType::None`),
`stop` is ignored and `self` position is unmodified.

The applied rate of the segment will be set to 1.0 by default.
If the caller can apply a rate change, it should update `self`
rate and applied_rate after calling this function.

`update` will be set to `true` if a seek should be performed to the segment
position field. This field can be `false` if, for example, only the `rate`
has been changed but not the playback position.
## `rate`
the rate of the segment.
## `format`
the format of the segment.
## `flags`
the segment flags for the segment
## `start_type`

segment. Compared to `Segment::position_from_running_time` this function can
return negative segment position.

This function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize buffers
against the clock or each other.

`running_time` can be any value and the result of this function for values
outside of the segment is extrapolated.

Translate `position` to the total running time using the currently configured
segment. Position is a value between `self` start and stop time.

This function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize to the
global clock in a pipeline. The running time is a constantly increasing value
starting from 0. When `Segment::init` is called, this value will reset to
0.

This function returns -1 if the position is outside of `self` start and stop.

the position in the segment

# Returns

the position as the total running time or -1 when an invalid position

segment. Compared to `Segment::to_running_time` this function can return
negative running-time.

This function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize buffers
against the clock or eachother.

`position` can be any value and the result of this function for values outside

in `running_time`.

When this function returns -1, the returned `running_time` should be negated
to get the real negative running time.
## `format`
the format of the segment.
## `position`
the position in the segment
## `running_time`
result running-time

# Returns

a 1 or -1 on success, 0 on failure.
<!-- impl Segment::fn to_stream_time -->
Translate `position` to stream time using the currently configured
segment. The `position` value must be between `self` start and
stop value.

This function is typically used by elements that need to operate on
the stream time of the buffers it receives, such as effect plugins.
In those use cases, `position` is typically the buffer timestamp or
clock time that one wants to convert to the stream time.
The stream time is always between 0 and the total duration of the
media stream.
## `format`
the format of the segment.
## `position`
the position in the segment

# Returns

the position in stream_time or -1 when an invalid position
was given.
<!-- impl Segment::fn to_stream_time_full -->
Translate `position` to the total stream time using the currently configured
segment. Compared to `Segment::to_stream_time` this function can return
negative stream-time.

This function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize buffers
against the clock or eachother.

`position` can be any value and the result of this function for values outside
of the segment is extrapolated.

When 1 is returned, `position` resulted in a positive stream-time returned
in `stream_time`.

When this function returns -1, the returned `stream_time` should be negated
to get the real negative stream time.
## `format`
the format of the segment.
## `position`
the position in the segment
## `stream_time`
result stream-time

# Returns

a 1 or -1 on success, 0 on failure.
<!-- enum State -->
The possible states an element can be in. States can be changed using
`ElementExt::set_state` and checked using `ElementExt::get_state`.
<!-- enum State::variant VoidPending -->
no pending state.
<!-- enum State::variant Null -->
the NULL state or initial state of an element.
<!-- enum State::variant Ready -->
the element is ready to go to PAUSED.
<!-- enum State::variant Paused -->
the element is PAUSED, it is ready to accept and
 process data. Sink elements however only accept one
 buffer and then block.
<!-- enum State::variant Playing -->
the element is PLAYING, the `Clock` is running and
 the data is flowing.
<!-- enum StateChange -->
These are the different state changes an element goes through.
`State::Null` &rArr; `State::Playing` is called an upwards state change
and `State::Playing` &rArr; `State::Null` a downwards state change.
<!-- enum StateChange::variant NullToReady -->
state change from NULL to READY.
 * The element must check if the resources it needs are available. Device
 sinks and -sources typically try to probe the device to constrain their
 caps.
 * The element opens the device (in case feature need to be probed).
<!-- enum StateChange::variant ReadyToPaused -->
state change from READY to PAUSED.
 * The element pads are activated in order to receive data in PAUSED.
 Streaming threads are started.
 * Some elements might need to return `StateChangeReturn::Async` and complete
 the state change when they have enough information. It is a requirement
 for sinks to return `StateChangeReturn::Async` and complete the state change
 when they receive the first buffer or `EventType::Eos` (preroll).
 Sinks also block the dataflow when in PAUSED.
 * A pipeline resets the running_time to 0.
 * Live sources return `StateChangeReturn::NoPreroll` and don't generate data.
<!-- enum StateChange::variant PausedToPlaying -->
state change from PAUSED to PLAYING.
 * Most elements ignore this state change.
 * The pipeline selects a `Clock` and distributes this to all the children
 before setting them to PLAYING. This means that it is only allowed to
 synchronize on the `Clock` in the PLAYING state.
 * The pipeline uses the `Clock` and the running_time to calculate the
 base_time. The base_time is distributed to all children when performing
 the state change.
 * Sink elements stop blocking on the preroll buffer or event and start
 rendering the data.
 * Sinks can post `MessageType::Eos` in the PLAYING state. It is not allowed
 to post `MessageType::Eos` when not in the PLAYING state.
 * While streaming in PAUSED or PLAYING elements can create and remove
 sometimes pads.
 * Live sources start generating data and return `StateChangeReturn::Success`.
<!-- enum StateChange::variant PlayingToPaused -->
state change from PLAYING to PAUSED.
 * Most elements ignore this state change.
 * The pipeline calculates the running_time based on the last selected
 `Clock` and the base_time. It stores this information to continue
 playback when going back to the PLAYING state.
 * Sinks unblock any `Clock` wait calls.
 * When a sink does not have a pending buffer to play, it returns
 `StateChangeReturn::Async` from this state change and completes the state
 change when it receives a new buffer or an `EventType::Eos`.
 * Any queued `MessageType::Eos` items are removed since they will be reposted
 when going back to the PLAYING state. The EOS messages are queued in
 `Bin` containers.
 * Live sources stop generating data and return `StateChangeReturn::NoPreroll`.
<!-- enum StateChange::variant PausedToReady -->
state change from PAUSED to READY.
 * Sinks unblock any waits in the preroll.
 * Elements unblock any waits on devices
 * Chain or get_range functions return `FlowReturn::Flushing`.
 * The element pads are deactivated so that streaming becomes impossible and
 all streaming threads are stopped.
 * The sink forgets all negotiated formats
 * Elements remove all sometimes pads
<!-- enum StateChange::variant ReadyToNull -->
state change from READY to NULL.
 * Elements close devices
 * Elements reset any internal state.
<!-- enum StateChange::variant NullToNull -->
state change from NULL to NULL. (Since 1.14)
<!-- enum StateChange::variant ReadyToReady -->
state change from READY to READY,
This might happen when going to PAUSED asynchronously failed, in that case
elements should make sure they are in a proper, coherent READY state. (Since 1.14)
<!-- enum StateChange::variant PausedToPaused -->
state change from PAUSED to PAUSED.
This might happen when elements were in PLAYING state and 'lost state',
they should make sure to go back to real 'PAUSED' state (prerolling for example). (Since 1.14)
<!-- enum StateChange::variant PlayingToPlaying -->
state change from PLAYING to PLAYING. (Since 1.14)
<!-- enum StateChangeReturn -->
The possible return values from a state change function such as
`ElementExt::set_state`. Only `StateChangeReturn::Failure` is a real failure.
<!-- enum StateChangeReturn::variant Failure -->
the state change failed
<!-- enum StateChangeReturn::variant Success -->
the state change succeeded
<!-- enum StateChangeReturn::variant Async -->
the state change will happen asynchronously
<!-- enum StateChangeReturn::variant NoPreroll -->
the state change succeeded but the element
 cannot produce data in `State::Paused`.
 This typically happens with live sources.
<!-- struct StaticCaps -->
Datastructure to initialize `Caps` from a string description usually
used in conjunction with GST_STATIC_CAPS() and `StaticCaps::get` to
instantiate a `Caps`.
<!-- impl StaticCaps::fn cleanup -->
Clean up the cached caps contained in `self`.
<!-- impl StaticCaps::fn get -->
Converts a `StaticCaps` to a `Caps`.

# Returns

# Returns

the `Caps` of the static pad template.
Unref after usage. Since the core holds an additional
ref to the returned caps, use `gst_caps_make_writable`
on the returned caps to modify it.
<!-- struct Stream -->
A high-level object representing a single stream. It might be backed, or
not, by an actual flow of data in a pipeline (`Pad`).

A `Stream` does not care about data changes (such as decoding, encoding,
parsing,...) as long as the underlying data flow corresponds to the same
high-level flow (ex: a certain audio track).

A `Stream` contains all the information pertinent to a stream, such as
stream-id, tags, caps, type, ...

Elements can subclass a `Stream` for internal usage (to contain information
pertinent to streams of data).

a new `StreamCollection` message, which may or may not share some of
the `Stream` objects from the collection it replaces. The receiver can check
the sender of a stream collection message to know which collection is
obsoleted.

<!-- struct Structure -->
A `Structure` is a collection of key/value pairs. The keys are expressed
as GQuarks and the values can be of any GType.

In addition to the key/value pairs, a `Structure` also has a name. The name
starts with a letter and can be filled by letters, numbers and any of "/-_.:".

`Structure` is used by various GStreamer subsystems to store information
in a flexible and extensible way. A `Structure` does not have a refcount
because it usually is part of a higher level object such as `Caps`,
`Message`, `Event`, `Query`. It provides a means to enforce mutability
using the refcount of the parent with the `Structure::set_parent_refcount`
method.

A `Structure` can be created with `Structure::new_empty` or
`Structure::new`, which both take a name and an optional set of
key/value pairs along with the types of the values.

Field values can be changed with `Structure::set_value` or
`Structure::set`.

Field values can be retrieved with `Structure::get_value` or the more
convenient gst_structure_get_*() functions.

Fields can be removed with `Structure::remove_field` or
`Structure::remove_fields`.

Strings in structures must be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded. Other encodings are
not allowed. Strings may be `None` however.

Be aware that the current `Caps` / `Structure` serialization into string
has limited support for nested `Caps` / `Structure` fields. It can only
support one level of nesting. Using more levels will lead to unexpected
behavior when using serialization features, such as `Caps::to_string` or
`gst_value_serialize` and their counterparts.
<!-- impl Structure::fn new -->
Creates a new `Structure` with the given name. Parses the
list of variable arguments and sets fields to the values listed.

(as a GType), pointer(s) to a variable(s) to hold the return value(s).
The last variable argument should be `None`.

For refcounted (mini)objects you will receive a new reference which
you must release with a suitable `_unref` when no longer needed. For
strings and boxed types you will receive a copy which you will need to
release with either `g_free` or the suitable function for the boxed type.
## `first_fieldname`
the name of the first field to read

# Returns

`false` if there was a problem reading any of the fields (e.g.
 because the field requested did not exist, or was of a type other
 than the type specified), otherwise `true`.
<!-- impl Structure::fn get_array -->
This is useful in language bindings where unknown `gobject::Value` types are not
supported. This function will convert the `GST_TYPE_ARRAY` and

<!-- impl Structure::fn id_get -->
Parses the variable arguments and reads fields from `self` accordingly.
Variable arguments should be in the form field id quark, field type
(as a GType), pointer(s) to a variable(s) to hold the return value(s).
The last variable argument should be `None` (technically it should be a
0 quark, but we require `None` so compilers that support it can check for
the `None` terminator and warn if it's not there).

This function is just like `Structure::get` only that it is slightly
more efficient since it saves the string-to-quark lookup in the global
quark hashtable.

For refcounted (mini)objects you will receive a new reference which
you must release with a suitable `_unref` when no longer needed. For
strings and boxed types you will receive a copy which you will need to
release with either `g_free` or the suitable function for the boxed type.
## `first_field_id`

<!-- struct SystemClock -->
The GStreamer core provides a GstSystemClock based on the system time.
Asynchronous callbacks are scheduled from an internal thread.

Clock implementors are encouraged to subclass this systemclock as it
implements the async notification.

Subclasses can however override all of the important methods for sync and
async notifications to implement their own callback methods or blocking
wait operations.

# Implements

<!-- struct TagList -->
List of tags and values used to describe media metadata.

Strings in structures must be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded. Other encodings are
not allowed. Strings must not be empty or `None`.
<!-- impl TagList::fn new -->
Creates a new taglist and appends the values for the given tags. It expects
tag-value pairs like `TagList::add`, and a `None` terminator after the
last pair. The type of the values is implicit and is documented in the API
reference, but can also be queried at runtime with `gst_tag_get_type`. It
is an error to pass a value of a type not matching the tag type into this
function. The tag list will make copies of any arguments passed
(e.g. strings, buffers).

After creation you might also want to set a `TagScope` on the returned
taglist to signal if the contained tags are global or stream tags. By
default stream scope is assumes. See `TagList::set_scope`.

already in the element and (B) the ones that are supplied to the element (
e.g. via `TagSetter::merge_tags` / `TagSetter::add_tags` or a
`EventType::Tag`), how are these tags merged?
In the table below this is shown for the cases that a tag exists in the list
(A) or does not exists (!A) and combinations thereof.

<!-- struct TagSetter -->
Element interface that allows setting of media metadata.

Elements that support changing a stream's metadata will implement this
interface. Examples of such elements are 'vorbisenc', 'theoraenc' and
'id3v2mux'.

If you just want to retrieve metadata in your application then all you
need to do is watch for tag messages on your pipeline's bus. This
interface is only for setting metadata, not for extracting it. To set tags
from the application, find tagsetter elements and set tags using e.g.
`TagSetter::merge_tags` or `TagSetter::add_tags`. Also consider
setting the `TagMergeMode` that is used for tag events that arrive at the
tagsetter element (default mode is to keep existing tags).
The application should do that before the element goes to `State::Paused`.

Elements implementing the `TagSetter` interface often have to merge
any tags received from upstream and the tags set by the application via
the interface. This can be done like this:


```C
GstTagMergeMode merge_mode;
const GstTagList *application_tags;
const GstTagList *event_tags;
GstTagSetter *tagsetter;
GstTagList *result;

tagsetter = GST_TAG_SETTER (element);

merge_mode = gst_tag_setter_get_tag_merge_mode (tagsetter);
application_tags = gst_tag_setter_get_tag_list (tagsetter);
event_tags = (const GstTagList *) element->event_tags;

GST_LOG_OBJECT (tagsetter, "merging tags, merge mode = %d", merge_mode);
GST_LOG_OBJECT (tagsetter, "event tags: %" GST_PTR_FORMAT, event_tags);
GST_LOG_OBJECT (tagsetter, "set   tags: %" GST_PTR_FORMAT, application_tags);

result = gst_tag_list_merge (application_tags, event_tags, merge_mode);

GST_LOG_OBJECT (tagsetter, "final tags: %" GST_PTR_FORMAT, result);
```

<!-- struct Toc -->
`Toc` functions are used to create/free `Toc` and `TocEntry` structures.
Also they are used to convert `Toc` into `Structure` and vice versa.

`Toc` lets you to inform other elements in pipeline or application that playing
source has some kind of table of contents (TOC). These may be chapters, editions,
angles or other types. For example: DVD chapters, Matroska chapters or cue sheet
TOC. Such TOC will be useful for applications to display instead of just a
playlist.

Using TOC is very easy. Firstly, create `Toc` structure which represents root
contents of the source. You can also attach TOC-specific tags to it. Then fill
it with `TocEntry` entries by appending them to the `Toc` using
`Toc::append_entry`, and appending subentries to a `TocEntry` using
`TocEntry::append_sub_entry`.

Note that root level of the TOC can contain only either editions or chapters. You
should not mix them together at the same level. Otherwise you will get serialization
/deserialization errors. Make sure that no one of the entries has negative start and
 stop values.

Use `Event::new_toc` to create a new TOC `Event`, and `Event::parse_toc` to
parse received TOC event. Use `Event::new_toc_select` to create a new TOC select `Event`,
and `Event::parse_toc_select` to parse received TOC select event. The same rule for
the `Message`: `Message::new_toc` to create new TOC `Message`, and
`Message::parse_toc` to parse received TOC message.

TOCs can have global scope or current scope. Global scope TOCs contain
all entries that can possibly be selected using a toc select event, and
are what an application is usually interested in. TOCs with current scope
only contain the parts of the TOC relevant to the currently selected/playing
stream; the current scope TOC is used by downstream elements such as muxers
to write correct TOC entries when transcoding files, for example. When
playing a DVD, the global TOC would contain a hierarchy of all titles,
chapters and angles, for example, while the current TOC would only contain
the chapters for the currently playing title if playback of a specific
title was requested.

Applications and plugins should not rely on TOCs having a certain kind of
structure, but should allow for different alternatives. For example, a
simple CUE sheet embedded in a file may be presented as a flat list of
track entries, or could have a top-level edition node (or some other
alternative type entry) with track entries underneath that node; or even
multiple top-level edition nodes (or some other alternative type entries)
each with track entries underneath, in case the source file has extracted
a track listing from different sources).

 usually be a subset of the global TOC, e.g. just the chapters of
 the current title, or the chapters selected for playback from the
 current title)
<!-- struct TocSetter -->
Element interface that allows setting of the TOC.

Elements that support some kind of chapters or editions (or tracks like in
the FLAC cue sheet) will implement this interface.

If you just want to retrieve the TOC in your application then all you
need to do is watch for TOC messages on your pipeline's bus (or you can
perform TOC query). This interface is only for setting TOC data, not for
extracting it. To set TOC from the application, find proper tocsetter element
and set TOC using `TocSetter::set_toc`.

Elements implementing the `TocSetter` interface can extend existing TOC
by getting extend UID for that (you can use `Toc::find_entry` to retrieve it)
with any TOC entries received from downstream.

<!-- struct TypeFindFactory -->
These functions allow querying informations about registered typefind
functions. How to create and register these functions is described in
the section <link linkend="gstreamer-Writing-typefind-functions">
"Writing typefind functions"`</link>`.

The following example shows how to write a very simple typefinder that
identifies the given data. You can get quite a bit more complicated than
that though.

```C
  typedef struct {
    guint8 *data;
    guint size;
    guint probability;
    GstCaps *data;
  } MyTypeFind;
  static void
  my_peek (gpointer data, gint64 offset, guint size)

      return find->data + offset;
    }
    return NULL;
  }
  static void
  my_suggest (gpointer data, guint probability, GstCaps *caps)

a 0-length list.

# Returns


 a `None`-terminated array of extensions associated with this factory

that handles the given URI for reading or writing
(`Element::make_from_uri`).

Source and Sink plugins should implement this interface when possible.
